Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 1,"At this time there are no specific treatments for MOPD1. Treatment is generally supportive. Theprognosisis poor for affected individuals, with most of the reported patients dying within the first year of life.[1]"
Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 3,Treatment is usually focused on protecting primary (baby) and then permanent teeth with preformed pediatriccrownsand other interventions. The replacement of teeth might be considered in the future withdenturesand/or implants.[2]The following article featured in theOrphanet Journal of Rare Diseasesoffers more specific details regarding the treatment of dentinogenesis imperfecta.

Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I,"Treatment options for punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I generally include topical creams and removal of the lesions by a doctor. In some cases, oral medications may be prescribed to try to ease symptoms. These therapies can lead to temporary softening of the skin and a decrease in skin thickness.[11]Unfortunately, in many cases, treatment does not provide consistent or long-lasting results.[12]There has been some reported success using creams that break up thekeratindeposits on the skin, such ascorticosteroids, urea,salicylic acid, lactic acid, or vitamin A. Systemic therapy using vitamin D analogues, aromatic retinoids, and5-fluorouracilhas also been used. However, people on these medications often require chronic, low-dose therapy. These topical and systemic treatments carry a variety of side effects.[12]Surgery, including excision of affected areas of the skin and replacement with unaffected skin, has been used on lesions resistant to other forms of treatment. However, healing after surgery can be difficult. Treatment with a CO2laser may be possible for limited affected areas on the palms.[12]"
Familial breast cancer,"Management offamilialbreastcanceris generally focused onhigh-risk cancer screeningto allow for early detection and treatment of cancer. In general, theNational Comprehensive Cancer Networkrecommends high-risk breast cancerscreeningfor women who have: (1) a personal andfamily historysuggestive of a hereditary cancersyndromethat is associated with breast cancer or (2) a greater than 20% risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime based largely on family history. The recommended screening protocol includes:[4]Breast awareness andbreast self-examsClinical breast exams every 6-12 months beginning at age 30 or individualized based on the earliest breast cancer diagnosis in the familyAnnualmammogramand breastMRIbeginning at age 30 or individualized based on the earliest breast cancer diagnosis in the familyDiscussion of other risk reduction strategies such aschemopreventionand/orprophylacticsurgeriesIf the familial breast cancer is part of a known hereditary cancer syndrome, management will also include screening for the other associated cancers.

Brenner tumor of ovary,Treatment of Brennertumorsof the ovary usually consists of surgery to remove the tumor.[2][3]The age of the patient may be a factor in deciding the extent of the operation.[2]
Pachygyria,"Because the symptoms of the condition vary from person to person, treatment is symptomatic, and may include anti-seizuremedication, such asTrileptal, and special or supplemental education consisting of physical, occupational, and speech therapies.[1][2]"
Pseudopelade of Brocq,"Pseudopelade of Brocq, like most scarring alopecias, is difficult to treat. Treatment, when indicated, focuses on prevention of disease progression. Patients with active lesions and in whom less than 10% of the scalp is involved may benefit from a combination of topicalcorticosteroidsand corticosteroids injected directly into the scalp lesions. Patients with more extensive disease or patients who do not respond to steroids may be offeredhydroxychloroquine. The hydroxychloroquine may be combined initially withprednisoneuntil the hydroxychloroquine has had time to take effect. Hydroxychloroquine therapy can have serious side effects, so blood work and special testing should be performed before and during the course of treatment. Though hydroxychloroquine therapy may be used by some as a first-line therapy, some believe it is most useful in patients with underlying discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Additional treatment options includeisotretinoinand mycophenolate mofetil. Surgery might be considered in patients whose condition has remained stable for one year.[4]"
Dermatitis herpetiformis,"Theantibioticdapsoneis extremely effective in treating this condition.[2]Symptomatic improvement may occur in as little as several hours after the first dose.[3]However, dapsone may cause serious side effects and requires regular monitoring by a physician. When this medication is used to relieve the symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, it should be taken in the smallest effective dose and for the shortest period possible.[4]In some cases, immunosuppressive medications may be used. These medications do not appear to be as effective.[2]A strictgluten-free dietis also recommended to help control the disease. Following this diet may eliminate the need for medications and prevent later complications.[2][3]"
Brody myopathy,"There is no one treatment for Brody myopathy. Certain muscle relaxants, such asdantroleneand blood pressure medications called calcium channel blockers, such asverapamilhave been used with varying levels of success.[5][3]"
Bronchiolitis obliterans,"Although there is no cure for bronchiolitis obliterans, treatment may help stabilize or slow its progression. The best treatment options and the effectiveness of the selected treatments vary based on the underlying cause and the severity of the condition. Medications often prescribed to people with bronchiolitis obliterans include certain types ofantibiotics(called macrolide antibiotics),corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive drugs. In severe cases,lung transplantationmay be recommended. Therapies such as cough suppressors or supplemental oxygen can also be given to manage the symptoms associated with the condition.[1][3]"
Multiple familial trichoepithelioma,"Several therapies have been used to treat multiple trichoepitheliomas, with variable to poor results. A single trichoepithelioma may be treated with surgery.Cryosurgeryorlaser surgerymay be used to remove multiple trichoepitheliomas.[1][2]Imiquimod creamhas also been used as a treatment for trichoepitheliomas, with some improvement in symptoms.[8]Other treatments have includeddermabrasion, photodynamic therapy, and other medications.[9][10]However, in most cases, multiple trichoepitheliomas eventually regrow following treatment.[9]"
Brown syndrome,"Treatment recommendations vary depending on the cause and severity of the condition. In mild cases, a watch and wait approach may be sufficient. Visual acuity should be monitored. First line therapy usually involves less invasive options such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications likeIbuprofen.  Acquired cases of inflammatory Brownsyndromemay be successfully treated withcorticosteroids. Surgery is considered in cases which present with double vision, compromised binocular vision, significant abnormalities in head position or obvious eye misalignment when looking straight ahead.[1]You can find additional information regarding treatment of Brown syndrome through PubMed, a searchable database of biomedical journal articles.

Brown-Sequard syndrome,"Treatment for individuals with Brown-Sequardsyndromefocuses mainly on the underlying cause of the disorder. Early treatment with high-dose steroids may be beneficial in many cases.[1]Physical, occupational and recreational therapy are important aspects of patient rehabilitation.[2]Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[1]More detailed information regarding treatment for Brown-Sequard syndrome can be accessed throughMedscape Reference. You may need to register to view the medical textbook, but registration is free."
Riboflavin transporter deficiency,"Treatment with riboflavin therapy (high-dose supplementation of riboflavin) has been used since 2010 and appears to be effective and possibly life-saving. Therefore, treatment should begin as soon as a riboflavin transporter deficiency is suspected, and should continue unless the diagnosis is ruled out withgenetic testing.[1]Improvement of symptoms may occur within days to months after starting treatment, and starting treatment early appears to be associated with better and more rapid improvement.[4]More detailed information about this treatment and supportive care is available here on the GeneReviews website."
Budd-Chiari syndrome,"The treatment of Budd-Chiarisyndromevaries, depending on the cause of the blockage. Medical treatments may include:[4]Blood-thinning (anticoagulation) medicationsClot-busting drugs (thrombolytic treatment)Treatment for the liver disease, including ascitesSurgical treatments may also be considered and include:[4]AngioplastyandstentplacementTransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)Venous shunt surgeryWhile medical therapy can be instituted for short-term, symptomatic benefit, medical therapy alone has been associated with a high 2-year mortality rate (80-85%).[5]In cases of severe cirrhosis liver transplant may be needed.[5]You can view more detailed information regarding the medical and surgical options for treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome by visiting theMedscape Reference website onBudd-Chiari syndrome treatment & managment. You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free."
Buerger disease,"Currently there is not a cure for Buerger disease, however there are treatments that can help control it. The most essential part of treatment is to avoid all tobacco and nicotine products.[7][4][8]Even one cigarette a day can worsen the disease.[7]A doctor can help a person with Buerger disease learn about safe medications and programs to combat smoking/nicotine addiction. Continued smoking is associated with an overall amputation rate of 40 to 50 percent.[8]The following treatments may also be helpful, but do not replace smoking/nicotine cessation:[4][7][8]Medications to dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow (e.g., intravenous Iloprost)Medications to dissolve blood clotsTreatment with calcium channel blockersWalking exercisesIntermittent compression of the arms and legs to increase blood flow to your extremitiesSurgical sympathectomy (a controversial surgery to cut the nerves to the affected area to control pain and increase blood flow)Therapeutic angiogenesis (medications to stimulate growth of new blood vessels)Spinal cord stimulationAmputation, if infection or gangrene occurs"
Kennedy disease,"There is currently no cure for Kennedy disease. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms, maintain maximal function, and improve quality of life.Physical therapyand rehabilitation, including the use of braces and walkers, are the best chance for remaining ambulatory as the disease progresses. Some people with Kennedy disease have breast reduction surgery forgynecomastia.[2]The use of anti-androgens have been shown to improve some aspects of the disease is some people; the androgen-dependent nature of the disease is the rationale for the use of anti-androgens in treating Kennedy disease.[4]Complications resulting from bulbar weakness, such as asphyxiation and aspiration pneumonia, can be life threatening. People with bulbar weakness should be counseled on the importance of cutting their food into small pieces for eating, and avoiding items that may be difficult to chew and then swallow.[2]The severity and progression of Kennedy disease should be monitored. Because it is slowly progressive, it is important to periodically assess strength and tolerance to exertion. This allows for proactive management to minimize the risk for falls, optimize mobility, and provide appropriate assistive devices.[4]"
Kindler syndrome,"Currently there is no cure or established treatment for Kindlersyndrome. Therefore, the goals of management are to treat the symptoms and prevent complications.When possible, children with Kindler syndrome should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists, which may include adermatologist,ophthalmologist, dentist,gastroenterologist,urologist, anddietitian. This is best achieved in a center with experience in caring for children with skin fragility.Skin care may include standard blister care; using moisturizers; and avoiding skin trauma and sun exposure. Mucosal involvement may require lubrication of the cornea; regular dental care for optimal oral hygiene to reduce periodontal disease; and management of gastrointestinal and urethral complications.Cancerscreeningshould begin in adolescence and be repeated annually. This may include screening forpre-malignant keratosesand earlysquamous cell carcinomas.[3]"
Wells syndrome,"The skin symptoms associated with wellssyndromeare typically treated withoralortopical corticosteroidssuch asPrednisone. Other medications that may be used to treat this condition include antifungal drugs,antibiotics,immunosuppressants, and/orantihistamines(H1 receptor antagonists).[2][3]Medscape Reference'sWeb site offers more specific information about the different medications that are often used to treat Wells syndrome. Please click the link to access this resource."
Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter,"Treatment for leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is supportive, aiming to alleviate symptoms. Management may includephysical therapyand rehabilitation for motor dysfunction (mainlyspasticityandataxia); and anti-seizuremedications for seizures.[2]Infections and fevers should be prevented when possible through the use of vaccinations; low-dose maintenanceantibioticsduring winter months; antibiotics for minor infections; and antipyretics (fever-reducing medications) for fever. For children, wearing a helmet outside can help minimize the effects of head trauma. Contact sports, head trauma, and stressful situations (including high body temperature) should be avoided.[2]More detailed information about the management of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is available on the GeneReviews Web site."
CADASIL,"There is currently no treatment for CADASIL that is proven to be effective. While antiplatelet treatment is often used, it is also not proven to be useful. Migraine should be treated both symptomatically and prophylactically (with preventative methods), depending on the frequency of symptoms. Whenhypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) are also present, they should be treated. Supportive care, including practical help, emotional support, and counseling, is useful for affected people and their families. Smoking increases the risk of stroke, so affected people who smoke should quit.[4]"
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"The best treatment options forcongenitaladrenal hyperplasia (CAH) depend on many factors including the type of CAH and the signs and symptoms present in each person. Many people with CAH requiresteroidsto replace the lowhormones. These medications will need to be taken daily throughout life or the symptoms of CAH may return. It is important that affected people on medications be closely followed by their healthcare provider because their dose may need to be adjusted at different times in life such as periods of high stress or illness.Girls with severe CAH who are born withambiguous genitaliamay undergo surgery to ensure proper function and/or to make the genitals look more female.[2][3][4]For more information on the treatment of CAH, pleaseclick here."
Pilomatrixoma,"Pilomatrixomas are usually surgically removed (excised). In most cases, thetumorsdo not grow back (recur) after surgery, unless the removal was incomplete.[2][1]"
CREST syndrome,"Unfortunately, CRESTsyndromehas no known cure.  Treatment generally focuses on relieving  symptoms and preventing complications:[4]Calcinosis: No treatment seems to be available to prevent or eliminate calcinosis.  Large or painful calcium deposits sometimes need to be surgically removed, and amputation of fingertips may be necessary if the skin ulcers progress to gangrene.[5]One or a combination of the following treatments may be tried on a case-by-case basis; however, larger studies are needed to prove efficacy.Corticoids oral or injected inside the lesion (intralesional)ProbenecidDiltiazemWarfarinAluminum hydroxideBisphosphonateMinocyclineColchicineIntravenous immunoglobulin therapyRaynaud phenomenon: The following treatment is suggested for the treatment of people with Raynaud phenomenon:Reduce and removerisk factorsand possible triggers such as smoking, avoid a medication known as beta-blockers, and avoid any other remediable underlying cause (eg, use of vibratory equipment)Keep hands and body warmTake a medication that are long-acting formulations of calcium channel blockersUse topical nitroglycerin paste  if needed.Esophageal dysmotility: The treatment of esophageal dysmotility and gastroesophageal reflux in people with scleroderma is the same as in patients without scleroderma. Treatment involves behavior changes, medication (H2 blockers), and a surgical procedure (esophageal dilatation) in more severe cases.Esophageal dilatation can help when severe feeding difficulty or regurgitation occur due to an esophageal narrowing.Sclerodactyly: Treatments include medication (corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, D-penicillamine, IFN-gamma, cyclosporine, and cytostatic drugs). Skin involvement in CREST syndrome typically is not severe; therefore, treatment is not need in many cases.Telangiectasia:  Pulsed-dye laser treatment seems effective for the treatment the telangiectasia in the face, but this has not been specifically studied in CREST patients. Treatment may includeestrogen-progesteroneor desmopressin, laser ablation, or sclerotherapy.Other treatment may include stretching exercises for the finger joints, and  facial exercises that may help keep the face and mouth flexible, under aphysical therapistsupervision. If CREST syndrome is making it difficult to do daily tasks, anoccupational therapistcan help individuals learn new ways of doing things.[4]For example, special toothbrushes and flossing devices can make it easier to care for the teeth. Surgery may be necessary for some affected individuals.About 45% of people with systemic sclerosis may have depression  and 64% also develop anxiety, so it is recommended to have an early assessment and treatment..[4]For pain management, studies have shown thatoxycodoneis effective and safe for pain due to severe skin ulcers, whiletopical lidocainehelps reduce pain of the finger's ulcers in people with systemic scleroderma.[6][7]There are also some lifestyle changes and home remedies that may be helpful for some people with CREST syndrome. For example:[5]Wearing gloves and mittens is the weather is cool and/or dressing in layers and wear a hat, thermal socks and boots to maintain the body's core temperature and to reduce Raynaud's symptomsQuit smoking because nicotine constricts the blood vessels, making Raynaud's phenomenon worseEating soft, moist foods and chewing food well when having swallowing difficultiesEating small, frequent meals; avoiding  spicy or fatty foods, chocolate, caffeine, and alcohol; and avoid exercising immediately before or after eating to improve symptoms of acid reflux.Use of skin moisturizers and using an humidifier at home to improving moisture levels in the home  to ease skin and breathing symptoms.The information provided here is for general educational purposes only. Individuals interested in learning about specific treatment options for themselves or family members should speak with their doctors."
Chondrocalcinosis 2,"There is currently no cure for chondrocalcinosis 2. However, therapies are available to manage the signs and symptoms of the disease. During episodes of joint pain, stiffness, or swelling, the following treatments may be recommended to relieve symptoms:[1]Joint aspiration(draining of fluid from the affected joint)CorticosteroidinjectionsNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin or ibuprofenFor people who have frequent episodes of pain or for whom other medications are not effective, small doses of a medication calledcolchicinemay be recommended. However, this medication has side effects and may not help everyone with chondrocalcinosis 2.[1]In some cases, people with chondrocalcinosis 2 may be required to wear a splint or brace to prevent too much movement. In other cases,physical therapymay be recommended for safe movement of the affected joint.[2][5]"
La Crosse encephalitis,"There is no specific treatment for LAC encephalitis. Severe cases are treated with supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, IV fluids and prevention of other infections.[2]"
Camurati-Engelmann disease,"Treatment for Camurati-Engelmann disease depends on the symptoms and severity in each person. Several medications, includingcorticosteroids,biphosphonates, andnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs), have been used to manage the symptoms of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). NSAIDs and bisphosphonates have not been proven to be effective for most people with CED. Corticosteroids may relieve some of the symptoms such as pain and weakness, and can also improve gait and exercise tolerance. However, they have serious side effects with long-term use.[2][3][5][6][7]More recently,losartan, anangiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, has been reported to reduce limb pain and increase muscle strength in multiple case reports.[6][7]However, the use of losartan needs more study to determine if it is effective and safe for those with CED. Exercise programs, when tolerated, have also been found to be beneficial.[6][7]Surgical procedures may also be needed in people with CES. Craniectomy, which involves removing a portion of the skull to relieve pressure on the brain, may be needed to reduce intracranial pressure and relieve symptoms in some people. Myringotomy, a procedure used to relieve pressure within the middle ear, may improve conductivehearing lossfrom fluid build-up in the ear.[3]Ongoing surveillance by various specialists may be needed to monitor signs and symptoms and make sure medical therapies remain safe to use. Depending on each person's symptoms and treatment, a person with CES may need periodic blood pressure checks, blood tests, neurologic exams, hearing evaluations, eye exams, bone density scans, or other types of surveillance. Children with CES should have routine growth monitoring, and those with cranial involvement (including those treated surgically) should continue to be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.[3]Please note: Case reports detail the signs and symptoms in individual cases. It is important to keep in mind that the features documented in these case reports are based on specific individuals and may not necessarily apply to others with the same disease."
CANOMAD syndrome,"Oral or intravenouscorticosteroids, ß-interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange, andcytotoxicdrugs and a combination of these therapies have all been used in treating CANOMADsyndromewith varying success. Their use, however, has not been evaluated systematically.[1][2][3][4][5]In recent years, IVIG seems to be the preferred method of treatment.[6][7]"
Dentinogenesis imperfecta,"The aims of treatment for dentinogenesis imperfecta are to remove sources of infection or pain, restore aesthetics, and protect teeth from wear. Treatment varies according to the age of the patient, severity of the problem, and presenting complaint. Treatment options includeamalgamsas dental fillings, veneers to fix the discoloration of teeth,crowns, caps, and bridges.[6]Denturesor dental implants may be necessary if the majority of teeth are lost.[3]Some dentists may also recommendresin restorationsand teeth bleaching.[7]More detailed information regarding the treatment of dentinogenesis imperfecta can be found by visiting the following web links:https://www.dentistry.unc.edu/dentalprofessionals/resources/defects/di/http://www.ojrd.com/content/3/1/31"
Systemic capillary leak syndrome,"There is currently no cure for systemic capillary leaksyndrome(SCLS). Treatment for SCLS during an episode is mainly supportive, aiming to stabilize symptoms and prevent severe complications.[3]This may involve stabilizing the airway and breathing, taking certain medications, and/or intravenous (IV) infusion of fluids, medications, or blood products.[2]Some have suggested that IV fluids are not recommended because it may worsen swelling (edema) or increase the risk for other complications.[4]Once a person begins to recover,diureticsare almost always required.[2]Periodic infusions or the use of certain medications are used to try to prevent future episodes (prophylactictherapy). Having monthly infusions of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) has been suggested.[2]A study published in 2017 found that preventive treatment with IVIG was the strongest factor associated with survival in people with SCLS.[5]Those who do not improve with IVIG or who cannot tolerate the therapy may have success withtheophyllineandterbutaline.[2]Research into how SCLS develops and factors that affect its course are underway, in hopes that a better understanding of SCLS will lead to more effective treatment options and a lower mortality rate."
Squamous cell carcinoma,"Skincancergenerally has a high cure rate if it is treated early. Treatment depends on how big thetumoris, its location, and how far it has spread (metastasis).[2]Methods of treatment for squamouscellcarcinoma may include:Curettage and desiccation - scraping away the cancer and using electricity to kill any remaining cancer cells; this is used to treat cancers that are not very large or deep[1][2]Surgical excision - cutting out of the tumor and stitching up the remainingtissue[1]Radiation therapy(if the skin cancer is located in an area difficult to treat surgically)[1]Microscopically controlled excision (Mohs surgery) - repeated cutting out of small pieces of tissue that are then examined microscopically to check if any cancer has been left behind; repeated application of this technique minimizes the removal of healthy tissue and is cosmetically more satisfying, especially if carried out with aplastic surgeonas part of the medical team.[1][2]This is more likely to be used for skin cancers on the nose, ears, and other areas of the face.[2]Cryosurgery - freezing and killing the cancer cells[2]Skin creams and medications - may be used to treat superficial (not very deep) squamous cell carcinoma.[2]The outlook for small squamous cell lesions that are removed early and completely is extremely favorable, with about 95% cured if they are removed promptly.[1][2]"
MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome,"There is not currently a cure for MED13L haploinsufficiencysyndrome. Treatment for the condition is often based on the needs of each individual. For people with this condition who have heart malformations, surgery may be necessary. Other possible treatment options include behavioral, speech, and occupational therapy to improve symptoms of the condition.[2]"
Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome,"Xerosis(dry skin) andpruritus(itching) associated with cardiofaciocutaneoussyndromemay be relieved by increasing the amount of moisture in the air or by using hydrating lotions. If signs of infection develop, treatment withantibioticsmay be necessary.[2]"
