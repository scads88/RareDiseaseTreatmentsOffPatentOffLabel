Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Mixed connective tissue disease,"There is currently no cure for mixedconnective tissue disease(MCTD). However, treatments can help manage symptoms of the condition. For example, medications such as over-the-counter or prescriptionnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsmay help with inflammation and pain of the muscles or joints.Glucocorticoidsmay be recommended in certain situations, such as during disease flares or when complications arise (e.g.,aseptic meningitis,myositis,pleurisy,pericarditis, andmyocarditis). Some people with MCTD require long term use of immunosuppressant medications.[1][7]Additional medications may be prescribed based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, if a person with MCTD has developed symptoms similar to those of lupus, medications typically prescribed for people with lupus may be recommended.[2]For additional information about the treatment of MCTD, visitthe Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and ResearchWeb site."
Melnick-Needles syndrome,"There is no cure for Melnick-Needlessyndrome. Treatment typically involves a team of specialists and focuses on addressing the symptoms of the condition, which may include:[2]Hearing aidsCosmetic surgery as desired to correct characteristic facial featuresOrthopedic surgery to correctscoliosisand other bone abnormalitiesThe use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)  and mandibular distraction (surgery to increase the size of the jaw) for individuals with severemicrognathiaandtracheobronchomalacia"
Melorheostosis,"Data on treatment for melorheostosis is limited, however non-surgical
and surgical approaches to manage pain has been described in single
cases with some success:[1]Bisphosphonate therapy was successful in
managing pain in a man with melorheostosis and elevated serum alkaline
phosphatase. Nifedipine was used to treat a woman with melorheostosis
and aching, burning pain deep in her upper left thigh. While the
treatment was helpful in managing pain, the treatment was withdrawn due
to unwanted side-effects. Pain was addressed in two additional cases
with cortical fenestration, or surgically cutting an opening in large
bone lesions.[1]The limited movement in affected joints
(contracture) can be difficult to treat and may be permanent. Tailored
surgery to address the bone deformity, hardened surrounding softtissues,
and joint contractures have been preformed with variable results.
Symptoms can recur following surgery. Surgery  may also be an option for
treatment of limb length discrepancy.[1]"
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B,"People with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) are recommended to have theirthyroidremoved (thyroidectomy) as soon as they are diagnosed. This is because the risk formedullary thyroid carcinomais nearly 100% in people who have MEN2B, and a thyroidectomy can prevent a person from ever developing medullary thyroid carcinoma.[2]After the thyroid is removed, a person with MEN2B may still have tests to make sure a medullary thyroid carcinoma did not develop and spread before the thyroid was removed.[2]If the medullary thyroid carcinoma cannot be completely removed, there are therapies available such astyrosine kinase inhibitors. These therapies can slow the growth of medullary thyroid carcinomas.[5]People who have thyroidectomies need to take medications that contain thehormonesthat are normally produced by the thyroid.[2]People with MEN2B may also be recommended to have frequent tests such as analysis of the blood or urine for signs that there may be atumorin theadrenal glands(pheochromocytoma).Imagingtests such asMRIorCT scancan also be used to monitor for the development of a pheochromocytoma.[2]If a pheochromocytoma is identified, it may be removed with surgery.[2]"
Ménière's disease,"At the present time there is no cure for Ménière's disease, but lifestyle modifications and some treatments can help affected people cope with the symptoms.[3]The symptoms of the disease are often controlled successfully by reducing the body’s retention of fluids through dietary changes (such as a low-salt or salt-free diet and no caffeine or alcohol).[1]Medications such as antihistamines, anticholinergics, and diuretics may lower endolymphatic pressure by reducing the amount of endolymphatic fluid.[2]Eliminating tobacco use and reducing stress levels may also help lessen the severity of symptoms.[1]Symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, and associated nausea and vomiting may respond to certain medications.[2]The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved a device for Ménière’s disease that fits into the outer ear and delivers intermittent air pressure pulses to the middle ear (pressure pulse treatment). The air pressure pulses appear to act on endolymph fluid to prevent dizziness.[1]Different surgical procedures are an option for people with persistent, debilitating vertigo.Labyrinthectomy(removal of the inner ear senseorgan) can effectively control vertigo, but sacrifices hearing and is reserved for patients with nonfunctional hearing in the affected ear.Vestibular neurectomy, selectively severing a nerve from the affected inner ear organ, usually controls the vertigo while preserving hearing but carries surgical risks. Recently, the administration of the ototoxicantibioticgentamycindirectly into the middle ear space has gained popularity worldwide for the control of vertigo associated with Ménière's disease.[1]"
Meningioma,"The treatment varies depending on the location of the meningioma and the symptoms caused by thetumor.[3][4]Careful observation is sometimes the best course of action for people with a meningioma. When treatment is necessary, surgery and radiation are the most common forms of treatment.[4][5]Radiation may be used if the meningioma cannot be operated on or if the meningioma is only partially removed by surgery. Radiation may also be used in cases of malignant, atypical, or recurrent tumors.[4]Other treatments that have been tried or are being explored includehydroxyurea, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors,platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors,immunotherapyto stimulate theimmune system, and somatostatin analogs which prevent the release of growthhormones.[4]"
Myelomeningocele,"A child with meningomyelocele usually hassurgery to close the myelomenigoceleshortly after birth. This prevents infections and helps save the spinal cord from more damage.[1]Children who also havehydrocephalusmay need aventricular peritoneal shuntplaced. This will help drain the extra fluid.[2]In the United States,antibiotics, sac closure, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement are the standard of care and are implemented soon after birth in 93-95% of patients.[4]"
Renpenning syndrome 1,There is currently no cure for Renpenningsyndrome. Management may include early educational intervention and treatment of any associated symptoms such as heart defects or eye abnormalities.[2]
Singleton-Merten syndrome,"There is still no cure. The treatment is done to treat the symptoms that may be present. The Singleton-Mertensyndromeis an interferonopathy. Drug options that have improved symptoms during the acute phase in people with an interferonopathy include:[1][2][4]Intravenous methylprednisoneOralprednisoneIntravenous immunoglobulinOther medications that have being used include anti-rheumatic drugs such as metrotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil,  azathioprine, as well as infliximab, etanercept, anakinra, tocilizumab, and rituximab but have not been effective in most cases.Other possible treatment include:[2][4]Treatment of tooth decay and use of dental implants as well as regular visits to the dentistTreatment of heart problems which may include surgery and medicationsGlaucomatreatment with eye drops, pills, laser surgery, and/or traditional surgeryOstoeporosis treatment such as medications known as  biphosphonatesSkin problems treatmentTreatment may require a team of medical specialists, depending on the different symptoms. Special social support,physical therapy, and other medical, social, and/or vocational services may benefit the people with the disease.Genetic counselingwould be of benefit for affected individuals and their families."
Weill-Marchesani syndrome,"Although there is no cure for Weill-Marchesanisyndrome, there are treatments that can help minimize or correct many of the symptoms that do develop.[3]People with this syndrome often need a team of medical specialists, includingpediatricians, eye specialists (ophthalmologistsandoptometrists),orthopedists, andcardiologists.[3][2]Regular eye exams are important for early diagnosis of eye problems. A timely diagnosis and treatment of developing eye problems is very important to increase the chance that vision loss can be minimized. Corrective glasses, visual aids, or eye surgery may be needed to improve vision. Removal of the microspherophakia is recommended to control intraocular pressure and improve vision. Increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) may be treated with eye drops, laser therapy, surgical removal of the iris or lens. Contraction or dilation of the pupils can cause glaucoma in some people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Medications that contract the pupil must be avoided, and medications that dilate the pupils must be given with care.[3][2]Joint stiffness and bone abnormalities can cause complications if anesthesia is needed. A person with Weill-Marchesani syndrome needs to tell their doctor, surgeon, and anesthesiologist of the diagnosis before receiving anesthesia, as the syndrome can impact airway management.[3]Recommended evaluations when a child is first diagnosed with Weill-Marchesani syndrome include:[1]Complete eye exam by anophthalmologistEvaluation by a medical genetics specialistCardiac echocardiogram"
Metatarsus adductus,"Most cases (over 90%) of metatarsus adductus will resolve without treatment. When treatment is needed, the type is determined by the flexibility of the foot. Stretching exercises may be used if the foot can be easily moved into the normal position. Splints and shoes may be used for moderate cases, although the benefit of these devices has not been clearly proven. In severe cases, casting may be required. This is best done early in development (before 8 months of age), and involves the use of multiple casts which are changed every 1 to 2 weeks. Surgery, although uncommon, may be used for cases in older children with persistent metatarsus adductus.[1][2]"
Metatropic dysplasia,"Treatment of this condition focuses on managing the skeletal concerns and maintaining the functioning of the lungs. Treatment may include the use of braces,physical therapy, and surgical correction of skeletal abnormalities.[2][3]"
MTHFR gene variant,"Having MTHFRgenevariants alone does not impact treatment. If a person has high homocysteine levels they should be carefully evaluated to identify all causes. Very high homocysteine levels rarely result from having the common variants alone. People with very high homocysteine levels should be carefully evaluated for other factors known to affect homocysteine, such as:[10][11][12]Low thyroidhormones(hypothyroidism)Chronic conditions (obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, physical inactivity,high blood pressure)Medications (atorvastatin, fenofibrate, methotrexate, andnicotinic acid)Dietary deficiencies (folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12)SmokingAdvanced ageTreatments and life-style changes are given based upon the patient's circumstances. As mentioned above, homocysteine levels can rise in people with and without MTHFR gene variants if they lack folate,choline, or B vitamins (B12,B6, andriboflavin).[10][11]People with concerns about their nutrition should speak with a healthcare professional. Supplements may be recommended if the person is found to have a nutritional deficiency.[3][10]Current clinical guidelines do not recommend changes in prenatal care or prenatal vitamins based upon MTHFR gene variant status alone. Women of childbearing age should take the standard dose of  folate supplementation to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.[4][14][16]Women with a previous child with a neural tube defect or afamily historyof neural tube defect should talk to their doctors about requirements for extra folate supplementation.[14]We recommend you speak with a trusted healthcare professional before taking any supplement."
Microcystic adnexal carcinoma,"Unfortunately, because microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rarecancer, there is currently not enough information to determine ifradiation therapyis an effective treatment for this disease.  There are no guidelines for the use of radiation therapy as treatment for microcystic adnexal carcinoma, and little is known about the dose of radiation that might be needed to be effective.[6]Two articles studying a total of 17 patients receiving radiation therapy for microcystic adnexal carcinoma have suggested that there may be a benefit of radiation therapy for decreasing the chances of thetumorregrowing (recurrence),[6][7]and the authors suggest that this treatment could be considered if there is evidence that cancercellsremain after surgery, or in situations where additional surgery cannot be done.[7]However, another article raises concerns about the use of radiation therapy considering the small number of patients studied, the report of one patient's disease potentially worsening after radiation therapy, and the belief that exposure to radiation may be a risk factor for the initial development of this tumor.[1]"
Microscopic polyangiitis,"The treatment of MPA is dependent on the extent of the disease, rate of progression, and the degree of inflammation. The goal of treatment is to stoporgandamage that occurs as a result of MPA and involves use of medications that suppress theimmune system. Treatment is typically carried out in three phases:[1][2][3]Remissioninduction usingprednisoneandcyclophosphamide. This phase usually lasts between 4 and 6 months.Remission maintenance using prednisone and replacing cyclophosphamide with other medications such asmethotrexateandazathioprine. This phases usually lasts between 12 and 24 months.Treatment of relapse utilizing medications from phase one or other therapies such asintravenous immunoglobulinfor resistant cases."
Mitochondrial genetic disorders,"Treatment for mitochondrial genetic disorders varies significantly based on the specific type of condition and the signs and symptoms present in each person. The primary aim of treatment is to alleviate symptoms and slow the progression of the condition. For example, a variety of vitamins and other supplements have been used to treat people affected by mitochondrial conditions with varying degrees of success. Other examples of possible interventions include medications to treatdiabetes mellitus, surgery forcataracts, andcochlear implantationforhearing loss.[4][1]For more general information about the treatment of mitochondrial genetic disorders, please visitGeneReviews."
Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome,"Establishing the correct diagnosis of MNGIE disease may help avoid unnecessary exploratory abdominal surgeries, risks associated with anesthesia, and inappropriate therapies. Cooperation among multiple specialties including neurology, medical genetics, nutrition, gastroenterology, pain management, psychiatry, and physical/occupational therapy can help with earlier detection and treatment of the various aspects of multi-organdysfunction that can occur in individuals with MNGIEsyndrome. However, once symptoms appear, treatment is generally supportive.[2]Management of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction can include: early attention to swallowing difficulties and airway protection, especially in severely affected individuals; dromperidone for nausea and vomiting; celiac plexus or splanchnic nerve block to reduce abdominal pain; nutritional support such as bolus feedings, gastrostomy tube placement, andtotal parenteral nutrition;antibiotictherapy for intestinal bacterial overgrowth; and medication regimens that may include morphine, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and phenytoin for relief of neuropathic symptoms. Special schooling arrangements are often necessary.Physical therapyand occupational therapy may help preserve mobility.[2]It is generally recommended that individuals with MNGIE syndrome avoid drugs that interfere with mitochondrial function including valproate, phenytoin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and certain antipsychotic medications.[2]There are some therapies for MNGIE syndrome under investigation, such as attempting to normalize the concentrations of thymidine inside thecellsto reduce the rate of themitochondrial DNAdamage, which progressively increases in an individual over time. Possible future treatments may include decreasing plasma thymidine concentration by reducing renal reabsorption of thymidine, bydialysis, and byenzymereplacement therapy (ERT).[2]Last updated: 6/6/2011"
Miyoshi myopathy,"There is currently no cure or definitive treatment for Miyoshi myopathy. Management should be tailored to each individual, depending on his/her specific signs and symptoms. A general approach to appropriate management can prolong survival and improve quality of life.[1]This approach may include:Physical therapyand stretching exercises to promote mobility and preventcontracturesUse of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobilitySurgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity andscoliosisUse of respiratory aids when indicatedSocial and emotional support and stimulation to maximize a sense of social involvement and productivity and to reduce the sense of social isolation common in these disorder[1]"
Multifocal motor neuropathy,"Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is considered treatable withintravenous immune globulin (IVIG). Early treatment shortly after symptoms begin is recommended.[5]Most people have a fairly rapid improvement in weakness with IVIG, but the improvement generally does not last beyond a few months. Maintenance IVIG infusions are usually needed every two to six weeks. For those with severe disease whose symptoms don't respond to IVIG (or for those who become resistant), treatment options are limited. Several reports have suggested thatcyclophosphamidemay be partially effective.[1]"
Stiff person syndrome,"Treatment aims to control symptoms and improve mobility and function. While some people on treatment for SPS may maintain reasonable levels of activity, the majority become increasingly disabled over time. Treatment options depend on the symptoms and severity in each person and may include:[2][3]Benzodiazepines - these are drugs that slow down the nervous system and may relieve muscle spasms and anxiety. They are generally considered the best initial therapy for SPS. Examples includediazepamandclonazepam.Baclofen- this is a muscle relaxant that may be used for people in whom benzodiazepines are not effective or not well-tolerated. Some people benefit from using baclofen in addition to benzodiazepines.Immune modulating therapies - these may be considered in people with severe symptoms who do not experience relief with benzodiazepines and baclofen. Options may includeintravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy,plasmapheresis(also called plasma exchange), andrituximab. However studies supporting the effectiveness and safety of these therapies for SPS are limited.Physical therapyand occupational therapy are also an important part of management for SPS and may help with side effects of medications (such as weakness) in addition to symptoms of the disease.[3]"
Orofaciodigital syndrome 2,"Although there is no one treatment for OFDS 2, there may be ways for a team of specialists to manage the signs and symptoms present in each individual. For example, reconstructive surgery might be performed to correct oral, facial, and/or finger and toe abnormalities.[1]"
Monilethrix,"Unfortunately, the is no cure for monilethrix. Some patients have reported spontaneous improvement, particularly during puberty and pregnancy, but the condition rarely disappears completely.[1][2]While there is no recognized definitive treatment for monilethrix, oralacitretinand topical 2%minoxidilhave shown good clinical and cosmetic results with continued use.[2][5][6]The systemic administration of vitamins, retinoids,griseofulvin, oral contraceptives, steroids,radiation therapy, external desquamative ointments, and steroid preparations have not show impressive results.[2]Avoiding trauma is perhaps the most effective method of managing monilethrix. This is because from birth, the hair of individuals with monilethrix tends to have an increasedsusceptibilityto weathering and cosmetic damage (e.g., sunlight exposure, dyeing, bleaching, perming, curling). This susceptibility to damage can prevent hair from growing to its maximum length.[2]"
Monogenic diabetes,"There are many forms of monogenic diabetes, and these are due tomutationsin differentgenes. Recent research results show that people with certain forms of monogenic diabetes can be treated with oral diabetes medications instead of insulin injections[1].People with monogenic forms of diabetes still need to check their blood sugar levels, however, they may not need to check as often as a person with type 1 diabetes[4]."
Morphea,"Treatment for morphea is aimed at controlling the symptoms and depends on the severity  and body surface area involved. In general, active disease (present <3 months or with symptoms of inflammation) is most responsive to treatment. Because morphea typically goes away on its own eventually, treating the condition is optional for  uncomplicated, localized cases.The majority of adults with morphea are managed with observation, topical medications, orphototherapy. Aggressive,systemic therapywithmethotrexateand/orglucocorticoidsis needed for those with active, deep morphea; lesions that may cause significant cosmetic disfigurement; jointcontractures; or other functional impairment. Occupational andphysical therapyare also important for those at risks for physical limitations. Phototherapy is also preferred for those with generalized morphea, but it is not an option for those with deep morphea due to the poor ability of ultraviolet light to penetrate deeptissues.[5]Detailed information about how morphea might be treated can be viewed here on Medscape Reference's website."
Mosaic trisomy 14,"Treatment for signs and symptoms of mosaictrisomy14 focuses on the specific features present in each individual. Infants withcongenital heart defectsmay need surgery or other therapies to alleviate symptoms and correct heart malformations. Respiratory infections should be treated aggressively and early. Some infants and children with the condition may need surgical repair of certain craniofacial, genital, or other abnormalities. Early intervention may be important in ensuring that children with the reach their potential. Special services that may be beneficial include special education,physical therapy, and/or other medical, social, and/or vocational services.[1]"
Mosaic trisomy 8,"Because mosaictrisomy8 affects many different areas of the body, medical management often involves a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for mosaic trisomy 8 varies depending on the signs and symptoms present in each individual. For example, for individuals with delays in motor skills such as walking,physical therapyoroccupational therapymay be helpful.Early interventionandspecial educationmay be recommended depending on the degree ofintellectual disability. If present,cleft palate, cardiac malformations, and kidney malformations may need to be surgically repaired. Other surgeries and interventions may be needed depending on the nature and severity of the other features and their symptoms.[2]"
Mosaic trisomy 9,"Because mosaictrisomy9 affects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this condition varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, children with bone or muscle abnormalities and/or delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) may be referred for physical or occupational therapy. Depending on the degree ofintellectual disability, a child may require special education classes.Heart defectsandcleft lip and/or palatemay need to be surgically repaired. Children withhydrocephalusmay be treated with certain medications and/or shunting (placement of a specialized device that drains excess fluid away from the brain). Other surgeries may be recommended depending on the nature and severity of the other features (i.e.craniofacial, muscular, skeletal, kidney, and/or reproductive system problems) and their associated symptoms.[1][2]"
Moyamoya disease,"Treatment for Moyamoya disease should begin early in the disease course to prevent severe complications.[4]Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, and is the only viable long-term treatment.[5]There are several types of revascularization surgeries that can restore blood flow to the brain by opening narrowed blood vessels, or by bypassing blocked arteries. While children usually respond better to revascularization surgery than adults, the majority of individuals have no further strokes or related problems after surgery.[6]No medication can stop the narrowing of the brain's blood vessels, or the development of the thin, fragile vessels that characterize the disease.[5]However, medications are used to treat many of the symptoms of the disease, and are often an important part of the management. Medications may include aspirin (to prevent or reduce the development of small blood clots);calcium channel blockers(which may improve symptoms of headaches and reduce symptoms related to transient ischemic attacks); and anti-seizuremedications (when needed for a seizure disorder). In a few cases, anticoagulants may be needed for people with unstable or frequent symptoms. However, they are not used long-term due to the risk of cerebral bleeding.[7]Additional information about the treatment of Moyamoya disease is available on Medscape Reference's Web site.People interested in learning about specific treatment options for themselves or family members should speak with their health care provider."
Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta,"Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) often resolves on its own within several weeks to several months. Depending on the severity of the condition and the symptoms present, treatment may not be necessary.[1][3]If treatment is indicated, there are many different therapies that have been used to treat PLEVA with varying degrees of success. These include:[1][2][3]OralantibioticsSun exposureTopical steroidsImmunomodulators (medications used to help regulate or normalize theimmune system)PhototherapySystemic steroidsUnfortunately, PLEVA may not always respond to treatment and relapses often occur when treatment is discontinued.[1]"
