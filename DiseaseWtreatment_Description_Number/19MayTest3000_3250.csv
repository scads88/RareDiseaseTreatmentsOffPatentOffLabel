Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"A person suspected to have Stevens-Johnsonsyndrome(SJS) should be admitted to the hospital immediately because it can be life-threatening. When the diagnosis is confirmed, the extent of the disease should be determined quickly so that the most appropriate place for treatment can be decided. People with SJS may be best treated in an intensive care unit, burn unit, or specialized dermatology unit. Several studies show that the chance of recovery is better for those moved promptly to a burn care unit or intensive care unit. Treatment should ideally be managed by a team of doctors experienced in treating SJS.[6]Treatment of SJS aims to address symptoms and prevent complications (supportive care). People thought to have SJS caused by a reaction to medications should discontinue the medication as soon as possible.[5][6]Generally, treatment of skin symptoms is similar to that of major burns, and includes wound care, pain control, fluids and electrolytes, nutritional support, temperature management, and monitoring or treatment of secondary infections.[5][6]Eye involvement needs immediate treatment to reduce the risk of permanent eye damage and vision loss. Eye inflammation can worsen quickly within a few days, so daily eye evaluations (by anophthalmologist) and aggressive treatment are needed. Treatment depends on the extent of eye involvement and may involve any of several strategies either alone or in combination, including:[5][6]Saline rinses to clean the eyes and eyelids.Lubrication multiple times per day with preservative-free eye drops or ointments (including for those with no apparent eye involvement).Eye medicines with topicalcorticosteroidsand broad-spectrumantibiotics.Amniotic membrane transplantation(AMT) to try to prevent vision loss and complications involving the mucous membranes. Some people need multiple procedures. The amniotic membrane is the innermost layer of the placenta, and can been used as a graft or dressing to aid in repairing the surface of the eyes and promote healing.Beyond supportive care, various therapies to treat SJS have been tried by doctors, including systemic corticosteroids,intravenous immune globulin(IVIG),cyclosporine,plasmapheresis, andanti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies. However, with the exception of thalidomide (which was found to be harmful), none have been adequately studied in randomized trials. There is, however, increasing evidence from multiplecase seriesthat cyclosporine may slow the progression of SJS.[6]"
Desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma,"Surgical resection (removal of the area of the brain with thetumor) has been the standard treatment reported in the medical literature. The size of the resection is probably based on the size of the tumor, although the extent of the resection is not documented for all cases reported in the medical literature.Adjuvant therapyis generally not performed when a gross total resection can be performed. When total resection is not possible, some of suggestedchemotherapy, as the effects of radiation on extremely young children may be harmful.[1]"
Neuromyelitis optica,"There is no cure for neuromyelitis optica, but there are therapies aimed at treating episodes in progress, reducing symptoms, and preventing relapses.[1]Sudden episodes and relapses are usually treated with intravenouscorticosteroids. If this does not relieve symptoms,plasma exchangemay be effective.[4][5]Low doses ofcarbamazepinemay be used to control painful muscle spasms during an episode. Muscle relaxants may be used forspasticitythat develops in those with permanent muscle dysfunction.[4]For prevention of recurrent episodes, the main treatment is long-term use of medication that suppresses theimmune system(systemic immunosuppressive therapy). There are no controlled trials evaluating this treatment, so recommendations are generally based on data fromobservational studiesand by the experience of experts who have treated the disease.[5]People with severe, permanent symptoms may benefit from collaborating withoccupational therapists,physical therapists, and social services professionals to address theirrehabilitationneeds.[1]"
Kartagener syndrome,"There is currently no cure for Kartagenersyndrome. Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.Airway clearance therapy, similar to that used incystic fibrosis, can loosen thick, sticky mucus so it can be cleared away.Antibioticsmay be prescribed to treat respiratory, sinus, and middle ear infections and may be given on a long-term basis in people withchronicor frequent infections. Surgery to insertear tubesmay be recommended in children withchronicear infections that are resistant to antibiotics. In people with severe lung disease,lung transplantationmay be an option.[1][2][3]For more information on the treatment and management of Kartagener syndrome, pleaseclick here."
Dextrocardia with situs inversus,"Treatment typically depends on the heart or physical problems the person may have in addition to dextrocardia with situs inversus. For example, infants born withcongenital heart defectsor otherorganmalformations may require surgery.[2][3]The management of people affected by Kartagenersyndrometypically includes measures to enhance clearance of mucus, prevent respiratory infections, and treat bacterial infections.[6]GeneReviewsoffers more specific information on the treatment of Kartagener syndrome and other types ofprimary ciliary dyskinesia. Please click on the link to access this resource."
Primary hyperoxaluria type 2,"The current management strategy includes high fluid intake, treatment with inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystallization, and temporary intensivedialysisfor end-stagerenal disease(ESRD) followed bykidney transplantation.[2][3]Varying success has been reported following transplantation, with recurrence being a real possibility since hyperoxaluria and elevated L-glycerate levels persist.[2][3][5]Careful management in the postoperative period, with attention to brisk urine output and use of calcium oxalate urinary inhibitors may help prevent complications.[2]To date, liver-kidney transplantation has not been used in primary hyperoxaluria type 2.[2][3]This strategy may be considered, however, as there is moreenzymein the liver than in othertissues.[2]More studies are needed before liver transplantation can be recommended.[3]Other treatment modalities needing further investigation include livercelltransplantation andrecombinant gene therapyto replace the missing enzyme.[6]"
Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy,"There is currently no cure for Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD) and treatment options are limited. Management of hereditary retinal dystrophies generally focuses onvision rehabilitation, which involves the use of low vision aids, orientation, and mobility training. The goal of visual rehabilitation is to reach maximum function, a sense of well being, a personally satisfying level of independence, and optimum quality of life.[4][5]Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the growth of new blood vessels in the choroid, can develop in people with DHRD and has a poor visualprognosis. The authors of a 2011 study reported that 2 people with DHRD and CNV were treated with a course of intravitreal bevacizumab (injected into the eye). This treatment stopped fluid leakage and led to increased visual acuity. They proposed that recovery of visual acuity after treatment of CNV in these cases shows that the loss of retinal function may be reversible. However, this finding needs to be confirmed in more studies with a larger number of participants.[6]There was also a case report of a person with malattia leventinese (a condition very similar to DHRD and sometimes considered the same) who was treated successfully withphotodynamic therapy using verteporfin. The treatment reportedly prevented severe visual loss in the patient. The authors of this case report proposed that photodynamic therapy be considered as a possible treatment in patients with malattia leventinese or DHRD who develop CNV.[7]You may consider participating in aclinical trialfor treatment of retinal dystrophy. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through the National Library of Medicine, developedClinicalTrials.govto provide patients, family members, and members of the public with current information on clinical research studies.There are many clinical trials currently enrolling individuals with hereditary retinal dystrophy.View a list of these studies here. After you click on a study, review its eligibility criteria to determine its appropriateness. We suggest reviewing the list of studies with your physician. Use the study’s contact information to learn more. You can check this site often for regular updates. Use ""retinal dystrophy"" or ""Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy"" as your search term."
Wolfram syndrome,"Treatment of Wolframsyndromeis supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, almost all affected people require insulin to treatdiabetes mellitus. People withhearing lossmay benefit from hearing aids orcochlear implantation.[2][4][5]For more detailed information regarding the treatment and management of Wolfram syndrome,click here."
Diabetic mastopathy,"Typically, no treatment is necessary for diabetic mastopathy. Individuals with this condition should be advised about the condition and how to self examine the breasts to detect any changes in size and number of breast lumps. Patients should be routinely followed up withMRIorultrasoundand corebiopsyif the lesions become clinically or radiologically suspicious. Lesions can be surgically removed for cosmetic reasons or if malignancy cannot be excluded.[9][7]"
Dieulafoy lesion,"Endoscopic techniques may be used to treat Dieulafoy lesions. These techniques may include the use of electrical current, heat, or argon gas to cause the blood to clot; injection of medications such as epinephrine; or the placement of bands or clips to close off the blood vessels.Angiographycan also be used to treat the abnormal blood vessels (embolization). In some cases, surgery, either alone or in combination with endoscopic techniques, may be indicated.[1][2][4][5][6]"
Diffuse dermal angiomatosis,"As this condition is quite rare, there are no established guidelines for the treatment of diffuse dermal angiomatosis of the breast.  Several treatments have been tried and seemed to be effective.  The goal of these treatments was to restore normal blood flow to the affected skin.  One woman was found to have a blocked blood vessel near the location of the diffuse dermal angiomatosis.  Surgery was performed to open this blood vessel, and the diffuse dermal angiomatosis healed following this surgery.[2]Two patients with this condition improved after treatment with the medicationisotretinoin; another patient improved after takingcorticosteroidmedication.[2][3]One patient underwent abreast reductionsurgery, and her diffuse dermal angiomatosis did not return following surgery.[4]"
Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia,"Due to the rarity of the condition, there are no well-established guidelines for the treatment and management of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrinecellhyperplasia (DIPNECH). Several medications have been studied as potential treatments for DIPNECH. Examples include somatostatin analogs (such asoctreotide), inhaledcorticosteroids, andshort-acting beta agonists. Although some  people with this disease reported temporary improvement in respiratory symptoms with the use of certain medications, none of the treatments were shown to be beneficial in all patients or to improve the overall outcome.[3]In very severe forms of the condition, palliative lung resection or even lung transplantation may be considered.[4]"
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis,"Treatment of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is focused on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, pain caused by DISH is often treated withpain relievers, such asacetaminophen(Tylenol, others) ornonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs), such asibuprofen(Advil, Motrin, others). Severe pain may be treated withcorticosteroidinjections. Muscle relaxants may also be helpful.[3][4][6]Physical therapyand/or exercise may reduce the stiffness associated with DISH and can help increase range of motion in the joints.[3][4][6]Even though few studies have focused on indications for surgery, it is generally accepted that surgery is indicated for people with severe symptoms (such asairway obstructionand/ordysphagia) in whom medication and therapy approaches have failed.[4][6]"
Unna-Thost palmoplantar keratoderma,The following treatments can help to soften the thickened skin and make it less noticeable:[1][3]EmollientsKeratolytics (such assalicylic acidin propylene glycol)Topical retinoidsTopical vitamin D ointment (calcipotriol)Systemic retinoids (acitretin)Antifungal medication may help if the condition occurs along with a fungal infection.[3]
Diffuse panbronchiolitis,"The main treatment that has been recommended for diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is the use ofmacrolide antibiotics.[2]Erythromycinis typically the first drug of choice.[1]A different macrolideantibioticmay be used if erythromycin is not well-tolerated or if a person doesn't improve after several weeks of therapy.[1]The best duration of macrolide therapy is not known, but most patients are treated for a minimum of six months. Therapy is continued until symptoms,imagingfindings, and lung function measurements are improved or stable. In the majority of patients, therapy is stopped after two years. However, in patients with advanced disease, therapy is continued indefinitely.[1]Other therapies, such asbronchodilatormedications and bronchial hygiene (airway clearance techniques), may be useful for some people.[1]"
Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis,"Presently there are no treatment guidelines for disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis (DPL). DPL is considered a benign condition and some cases of DPL resolve after the baby is delivered (if pregnant),hormone treatmentis stopped (including bothbirth control pillandhormone replacement therapy), or ahormoneproducingtumoris removed. However, surgery may be suggested based on the size and location of the tumor.[1][2][3][4]"
Pigmented villonodular synovitis,"Pigmented villonodular synovitis is first treated with surgery to remove as much of the abnormaltissuegrowth as possible.  The type of surgery depends on the location and extent of the disease within the joint.Radiation therapyis sometimes used to treat this condition if surgery is not an option, or if the condition returns (recurs) after an initial surgery.[1][4]"
Panuveitis,"Panuveitis may be treated in several ways, including injections around the eye, oral medications, and eye drops.[2][3]Corticosteroidsare the treatment of choice for most types of uveitis, including panuveitis. Depending on the severity of the disease,oral prednisoloneis typically started in a larger dose, and then is tapered off a few weeks after starting therapy as inflammation improves. A maintenance dose is typically used thereafter.[3]Immunomodulating drugs (drugs that alter the body's immune response) are needed if the inflammation cannot be controlled with corticosteroids or if active inflammation interferes with activities of daily living.[3][5]Cycloplegics (eye drops that temporarily paralyze the ciliary body) are used to help with pain due to ciliary spasms.[3]Forms of uveitis due to infectious agents are treated by specific antimicrobial therapy (antibiotics, antiparasitics or antivirals), with or without corticosteroids.[3]"
Digestive System Melanoma,"Treatment of digestive systemmelanomais dependent on the spread of thecancerand where it is located. Treatment might include surgery to remove thetumorand portion of the gastrointestinal tract involved,chemotherapy, andimmunotherapy.[2]"
Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency,"There are currently no consensus recommendations for the management of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency. Management can be hard because various metabolic pathways are affected and 3enzymecomplexes are involved. Deficiencies in enzyme pathways vary depending on the specificmutation(s) each affected person has.Unfortunately, the treatments that have been attempted in children with the early-onset neurologic form do not appear to significantly alter the course of the disease. Even with treatment, children often do not survive infancy or have varying degrees of chronic neurologic impairment if they survive the initial episode. Depending on individual enzyme complex deficiencies, treatment may involve certain dietary restrictions or certain diets; use of medical foods; and/or supplementation of specificamino acidsor other substances.There is limited data for the chronic management of people with the primarily hepatic (liver-related) form of the disease. Management typically involves supportive therapy during times of acute liver injury or failure, and may include nutritional support; IV glucose forhypoglycemia; correction of metabolic acidosis; correction of coagulopathy; and avoidance of liver-toxic medications.[1]More detailed information about the management of DLD deficiency can be viewed on the GeneReviews Web site. GeneReviews is intended for use by genetics professionals. Those not familiar with the principles discussed on the GeneReviews Web site are encouraged to speak with a genetics professional or other healthcare provider regarding information of interest."
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency,"Currently, no treatment or cure exists for theinborn error of metabolismform of DHD deficiency. Symptoms usually remain the same throughout the person's life.[3]"
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone,"Treatment ofsyndromeof inappropriate antidiuretichormone(SIADH) may involve fluid restriction, treatment of the underlying cause once determined, and medication that decreases the effect of antidiuretic hormone on the kidneys.[1]"
Lupus,"For information on the treatment of lupus, you can read the National Institute ofArthritisand Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) publication calledHandout on Health: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. NIAMS is the primary NIH organization for research and information on lupus."
Mal de debarquement syndrome,"Treatment options for mal de debarquementsyndrome(MdDS) are limited.[3][4][5][6]Most drugs that work for other forms of dizziness do not work for MdDS. On some cases, medications classified as vestibular suppressants, such as anti-depressants and anti-seizuremedications, may be used.[2]Customized vestibular therapy like optokinetic stimulation has been effective in some cases.[2][4]In recent years, a renewed interest in understanding the underlying cause of MdDS has led to new treatment options, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.[5]More studies into these treatment options are needed."
"47, XYY syndrome","The signs and symptoms of 47, XYYsyndromecan be managed with a variety of therapies.Occupational therapymay be recommended for infants and young boys who have low muscle tone (hypotonia), and speech therapy may be recommended for boys who havespeech delay. Boys with 47, XYY syndrome may be inspecial educationat school, or they may have extra help in some classes.[2][5]Other management options for boys with 47, XYY syndrome may includebehavioral therapyor medications for boys withattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)or behavioral problems. Ifautism spectrum disorderis present,applied behavioral analysis (ABA)therapy may be recommended.[2]In some cases, hormonal therapy may be used.[7]"
3-Hydroxyisobutyric aciduria,"There is no cure for 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria. Because it is so rare, there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of treatment. However, affected people have been treated with aprotein-restricted diet andcarnitinesupplementation with varying degrees of success.[1]"
Wandering spleen,"Because wandering spleen can cause life-threatening complications (such assplenic infarction,portal hypertension, and hemorrhage), surgery to remove the spleen is the preferred treatment method for patients.Laparoscopic splenectomyis the typical method used for spleen removal. Splenopexy (surgically fixing the floating spleen) is associated with a high risk of recurrence and complications and is not the preferred treatment choice.[1]"
Inclusion body myopathy 2,"Currently, there is no cure and no way to prevent the progression of a Inclusion body myopathy 2.[2]Treatment is focused on managing individual symptoms. People with this condition are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team includingneurologistsandphysiatrists, as well as physical andoccupational therapists.[3]Researchers at Hadassah, USC, UCLA, UCSD, Johns Hopkins University, Canada, NIH, and Japan are contributing towards finding an effective treatment. Information about treatments which are on the horizon are described in a publication from theAdvancement of Research for Myopathieswhich can be accessed byclicking here."
Myotonic dystrophy type 2,"There is currently no treatment available to stop or slow the progression of myotonic dystrophy type 2. Management options depend on the symptoms that each affected person has, and aim to treat each specific symptom. For example:[1]Ankle-foot braces, wheelchairs, or other assistive devices may be used as needed for weaknessDefibrillatorplacement may be needed for arrhythmiasCataractscan be removed for those with impaired visionTestosterone replacement therapymay be useful forhypogonadismin malesMyotonia is usually mild and rarely requires treatment. Routine exercise appears to help with pain control, as well as with muscle strength and endurance. The effectiveness of most medications for pain management varies.Mexilitene, which is very effective for some forms of myotonia, has helped control muscle pain in some people with this condition. Other medications that have been used with some success includegabapentin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), low-dose thyroid replacement, low-dose steroids, andtricyclic antidepressants. Cholesterol-lowering medications should be avoided when they are associated with increased weakness.[1]There are steps a person can take to prevent some secondary complications. Anesthetic risk may be increased, so careful assessment of heart and respiratory function before and after surgery are recommended. Affected people should also have a yearlyelectrocardiogramor cardiacMRIto detect possible conduction defects orcardiomyopathy.[1]You can seemore detailed information about the management of myotonic dystrophy type 2 on the GeneReviews Web site."
Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome,"Treatment of individuals with DMCsyndromedepends on the affected person's symptoms and is usually supportive. There is no cure for this condition. Treatments might include spinal fusion of the segments of the spinal column at the top of the spine or other means of vertebral stabilization. Additional surgical techniques may be used to correct various skeletal abnormalities such as dislocation of the shoulder and hip joints. In some cases, hip replacement is required. Children with DMC syndrome may benefit from early intervention and special educational programs.[1]"
Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but research is ongoing. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of DMD and related complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness and loss in order to maximize the quality of life. An enlarged, weakened heart (dilatedcardiomyopathy) may be treated with medications, but in severe cases aheart transplantmay be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses.[2][6]Gentle exercise is encouraged for people with DMD. Physical inactivity (such as bed rest) can worsen the muscle disease, but so can overexertion.Physical therapymay be helpful to maintain muscle strength and function. Orthopedic devices (such as braces and wheelchairs) may improve the ability to move and take care of oneself.[2][6]Steroids(corticosteroids) may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function. Steroid options include:[2][6]Prednisoneis a steroid that has been shown to extend the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. However, the possible side effects of prednisone include weight gain,high blood pressure, behavior changes, and delayed growth.Deflazacort(another form of prednisone), is used in Europe and believed to have fewer side effects and was recently approved in the United States by the FDA.Oxandrolone, a medication used in a research study, also has similar benefits to prednisone, but with fewer side effects.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  of United States approved Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) injection to treat people with DMD who have a change in theDMDgenethat will allow a shortened form of dystrophin to be made ifexon51 is skipped. An exon is the part of the gene that actually codes for theprotein. TheDMDgene has 79 exons. About 13% of those with DMD may be helped by Exondys 51.[7]Because chronic use of corticosteroids can lead to side effects, and rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids can result in life-threatening complications, there are recommended guidelines on how to proceed with withdrawal. ThePJ Nicholoff Protocolguides withdrawal from corticosteroids following long term treatment.[6]The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) has current information about themedical management of DMD."
Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1E,"There is currently no effective treatment for any type of hereditary sensory neuropathy. Management of symptoms may include:[2][3]meticulous care of the distal limbs, which includes proper fit of shoes, prevention and treatment of callus formation, cleaning and protection of wounds, and avoidance of trauma to the hands and feetinjury prevention when sensory impairment is significantthe use of hearing aids and/or assistive communication methods as neededsedative or antipsychotic medications to help reduce the restlessness, roaming behavior, delusions, and hallucinations associated withdementiapsychological support for caregivers"
Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency,"People affected by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency are generally treated with a medication calledlevodopa. The effectiveness of levodopa therapy varies significantly depending on the severity of the condition. People affected by the mild form of TH deficiency (TH-deficient dopa-responsivedystonia) generally respond well to treatment. In most cases, this medication is able to drastically improve or even completely alleviate associated symptoms.[2][3]Unfortunately, children with infantile parkinsonism or progressive infantileencephalopathy(the two severe forms of TH deficiency) may have an incomplete response to levodopa, or it may take several months to several years to see an improvement in symptoms. In many cases, affected children are also extremely sensitive to the drug and may experience negative side affects such as difficulties in performing voluntary movements (dyskinesia), vomiting and appetite suppression of appetite.[2][3]"
Double inferior vena cava,"Double inferior vena cava does not have a specified treatment, as this condition does not cause any clinical symptoms. Individuals with a double inferior vena cava who need surgery for other medical reasons may be treated more cautiously or in a different manner to prevent injury to the additional inferior vena cava.[1]Treatment may also differ for people who develop a blood clot and need aninferior vena cava filterto prevent apulmonary embolism.[3]In these cases, a person with double inferior vena cava usually requires the placement of two filters, one in each vein.[1][2]"
Dowling-Degos disease,"There is no cure for Dowling-Degos disease.[2][3][4]Many different treatments have been tried for this condition, but none has proven effective in eliminating the symptoms for all patients. Topical retinoic acids, topical steroids, hydroquinone,tretinoin, and systemic retinoids have been used without success.[2]Limited reports indicate at least temporary therapeutic benefit with topicaladapalene. Variouslaser systems(CO2and erbiumYAG) have also shown some promise.[3][4]Additional articles that address this topic can be accessed below:Wenzel G, Petrow W, Tappe K, Gerdsen R, Uerlich WP, Bieber T.Treatment of Dowling-Degos disease with Er:YAG-laser: results after 2.5 years.Dermatol Surg. 2003 Nov;29(11):1161-2.Wenzel J, Tappe K, Gerdsen R, Uerlich M, Philipp-Dormston W, Bieber T, Petrow W.Successful treatment of Dowling-Degos disease with Er:YAG laser.Dermatol Surg. 2002 Aug;28(8):748-50.Altomare G, Capella GL, Fracchiolla C, Frigerio E.Effectiveness of topical adapalene in Dowling-Degos disease.Dermatology. 1999;198(2):176-7."
Down syndrome,"Early intervention services, quality educational programs, a stimulating home environment, good health care, and positive support from family and friends can help people with Downsyndromedevelop to their full potential.[5]The overall goal of treatment is to boost cognition by improving learning, memory, and speech.[9]Other treatments depend on the specific health problems or complications present in each affected person. The Research Down syndrome Foundation have a webpage with information aboutactive reseach projects."
Duane syndrome,"The treatment of Duanesyndromemay involve surgery. The goal of surgery is to eliminate or improve head turn, eliminate or reduce significant misalignment of the eyes, reduce severe retraction (when they eyeball pulls into the socket as the eye moves toward the nose), and improve upshoots and downshoots (when the eye deviates upward or downward with certain eye movements). No specific surgical technique has been completely successful in eliminating the abnormal eye movements. However, some procedures, used either alone or in combination, may be successful in improving or eliminating head turns and misalignment of the eyes. The choice of procedure varies among affected individuals. The success rate for surgery in eliminating an abnormal head position is estimated to be 79-100%.[6]The management of Duane syndrome without surgery may include:[6]special seating in school to accommodate a child's head turnspecial rear-view mirrors to help during drivinga prism placed on the individual's glasses to correct for the face turn (though this is not commonly used)vision therapy to treat secondary convergence insufficiency (inability of the eyes to turn towards each other or sustain this position)More detailed information about the treatment of Duane syndrome is available on Medscape Reference's Web site and can be viewedhere. You may need to register to view this information, but registration is free."
Gigantomastia,"Breast reduction with or without hormonal therapy is often the first line of treatment for women who have gigantomastia. However, recurrence of gigantomastia may occur, requiring a second breast reduction procedure or mastectomy. Mastectomy might be recommended following recurrence of gigantomastia after breast reduction, especially in those patients who have  gigantomastia associated with puberty or pregnancy.[1]It is important to discuss this information with a health care provider in order to determine what treatment might be appropriate."
Duane syndrome type 1,"Management of Duanesyndromeis mainly supportive. It may involve treatment ofamblyopia(""lazy eye""); wearing glasses or contact lenses; the use of prisms to correct for abnormal head posture; or possible eye muscle surgery.[3][4]The majority of people with Duane syndrome do not need surgery.[5]However, surgery may be indicated if necessary to reduce severe misalignment of the eyes (strabismus); improve an unacceptable head position; treat a significant upshoot or downshoot; or fix displacement of the eyeball within the orbit (enophthalmos).[3][5]Unfortunately, surgery does not restore function to the affected nerve and muscle, and no surgical technique has been completely successful in eliminating the abnormal eye movements.[3]Surgery for Duane syndrome usually involves adjusting the other eye muscles to compensate and allow for better eye alignment.[5]While it cannot fix the underlying problem, it can substantially improve signs or symptoms.[5]Some surgical procedures or combinations of procedures may be successful in improving or eliminating head turns and strabismus.[3]"
Spinal muscular atrophy type 2,"The treatment of spinal muscular atrophy type 2 (SMA II) is based on the symptoms present.Physical therapy,occupational therapyand assistive devices (walkers, wheelchairs, etc) are generally recommended to help encourage maximum mobility and independence. These interventions may also prevent or delayscoliosisand abnormal contractions of the muscles and tendons. Some children with SMA II may have difficulty eating enough calories to maintain a normal weight. In these cases, nutritional counseling and/or afeeding tubemay become necessary. Breathing problems are also common in people affected by SMA II and may require the use ofBiPAP machinesor other methods of respiratory support. Some affected children may require surgery to treatscoliosisor severe cases of hip dislocation.[1][2]"
X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome,"X-linkedlymphoproliferativesyndrometreatment requires the coordinated effort of a team of specialists, such as apediatricianorinternist,immunologist,hematologist, andoncologist.[4]Because XLP can cause life-threatening conditions, it is important to identify males with XLP as soon as possible. Close monitoring (such as of EBV viral loads, IgG levels, blood counts, liver tests, inflammatorymarker, coagulation studies as needed) is a very important aspect of care.Treatment will vary depending on a variety of factors, including the severity of a person’s symptoms.[4][5]If a person is identified before EBV exposure, regular infusions with immunoglobulins (IgG replacement therapy) may be recommended to help prevent life-threatening infectious mononucleosis and the onset of other symptoms and findings potentially associated with XLP.[4]If a person with XLP is diagnosed after EBV exposure, treatment may include therapies to help prevent opportunistic infections associated with XLP, such asantibioticmedications, intravenous gammaglobulin therapy, and rituximab (to deplete B-cellsharboring EBV).[5][4]People with XLP are at risk forhemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis(HLH). HLH isa condition in which the body makes too many activatedimmune cells(macrophages andlymphocytes). Treatment of HLH may include a combination of strong immune suppressing medications followed by astem cell transplant.[4][6][5]Studies on new treatments for HLH have been completed in recent years (e.g., anti-thymocyte globulin), and others are underway (Toculizumab, Novimmune NI-0501, and Ruxolitinib).[6]It is hoped that new medications will improve success rates and long term outlook for people with HLH who undergo stem cell transplant.Bone marrow or stem cell transplant is currently the only definitive treatment for XLP1. A tailored discussion regarding the risks and benefits of transplant for each individual patient is critical.Some people with XLP have developed B-cell lymphoma. The lymphoma may be treated with surgery, radiation, and/orchemotherapy.Genetic counselingshould be offered to people with XLP and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.Studies investigating novel treatments, such as SLAM family inhibitors,geneediting, andgene therapy, have been underway.[5]Improvements in gene therapy techniques have resulted in better outcomes and less risk for adverse reactions. Gene therapyclinical trialsmay soon prove this approach to be a viable alternative to stem cell transplant.[5]"
Familial partial lipodystrophy type 2,"Individuals withfamilialpartial lipodystrophy type 2 may require the coordinated efforts of a team of specialists, including a primary care provider,cardiologist,endocrinologist,nutritionist,plastic surgeon, andpsychiatrist/psychologist.[2]Dietary modifications and daily physical activity can help improve the metabolic complications of lipodystrophy. Insulin sensitizers (such asmetformin) and lipid-lowering drugs (statins,fibrates) may also be helpful. Due to the risk of cardiac complications, individuals with familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 should have regular cardiac check-ups. Metreleptin has shown some promise as a treatment for this condition, however, it is not widely approved for treatment at this time.[2][1]The characteristic fat distribution seen in individuals with familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 cannot be reversed. For some individuals, cosmetic surgery may be beneficial in improving appearance and for management of metabolic complications. Liposuction may also be used to remove unwanted deposits of fat. Because familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 can cause anxiety and stress, psychological support is also an important part of treatment.[2]"
Duplication of urethra,"Treatment of this condition depends on the anatomy of theduplicationand its clinical features. Some people with mild symptoms do not require surgery.
