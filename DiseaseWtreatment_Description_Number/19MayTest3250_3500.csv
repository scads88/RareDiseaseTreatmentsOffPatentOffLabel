Eagle syndrome,"The mainstay treatment for Eaglesyndromeis surgery to shorten the styloid process (styloidectomy).[3]Traditionally, this surgery has been done using either an intraoral (through the mouth) or extraoral (through the neck) approach.[3][1]The intraoral approach usually requires tonsillectomy, and access to the styloid process is limited.[3]There is also risk of injury to major vessels.[1]However, this method reportedly is safe, more simple, and an external scar is avoided.[1]The extraoral approach may provide better exposure of the process and its surrounding structures. However, this approach results in a scar, requires going through connectivetissueand may carry an increased risk of trauma to surrounding structures.[3]In recent years, more minimally-invasive techniques have been used for head and neck surgery. Some patients with Eagle syndrome have undergone anendoscope-assisted approach.[3]An endoscope is a long, thin tube with a camera attached at the end. According to the authors of a study published in 2017, this approach reportedly has the benefits of providing direct surgical access, satisfactory exposure, and minimal invasion.[3]Medical management of Eagle syndrome may include the use of pain and anti-inflammatory medications, antidepressants, and/or steroids for pain.[1][3]The overall success rate for treatment (medical or surgical) is about 80%.[1]People with questions about personal treatment options and recommendations for Eagle syndrome should speak with their doctor."
Eales disease,"Depending on the disease stage, treatment may involvecorticosteroids(systemic or periocular) and/or immunosuppressants (azathioprine,cyclosporine).[3][4]Anti-tubercular therapy has been recommended by some authors, however this treatment remains controversial.[3]Bevacizumab(Avastin), amonoclonal antibody, is sometimes used via intravitreal injection. This medication appears to induce regression of neovascularization.[4]Laser photocoagulation has become the treatment of choice in patients in the proliferative stage of Eales disease. Vitreoretinal surgery may be required if recurrent vitreous hemorrhage occurs.[3][4]There may be other treatment options (for example, antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E) for Eales disease as well.[4]We recommend that you discuss these and other treatment options with your partner's health-care providers.You can find relevant articles on the treatment of Eales disease through PubMed, a searchable database of biomedical journal articles.

Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome,"There is no cure for LEMS. Treatment may vary depending on the individual's age, general health, and whether there is an associatedcanceror autoimmune disorder. If cancer or an underlying autoimmune disorder is present, treatment should focus on these conditions first. They may result in symptom relief.[2][6]Medications and therapies that may be used to treat Lambert-Eaton myasthenicsyndromeinclude: 3,4-diaminopyridine (enhances acetylcholine release), anticholinesterase agents (e.g.,Pyridostigmine),  plasma exchange (where blood plasma is removed and replaced with fluid,protein, or donated plasma),intravenous immunoglobulins(IVIG), and medications that suppress theimmune system(e.g.,prednisone,azathioprine).[2]"
"Epidermolysis bullosa simplex, generalized","There is no cure for epidermolysis bullosa simplex and there is no known treatment proven to completely control all of the symptoms. However, many complications can be lessened or avoided through early intervention. Individuals with milder forms of the disease have minimal symptoms and may require little or no treatment. In all cases, treatment is directed towards the symptoms and is largely supportive. This care should focus on prevention of infection, protection of the skin against trauma, attention to nutritional deficiencies and dietary complications, minimization of deformities andcontractures, and the need for psychological support for the patient and other family members.[2]Detailed information regarding prevention of blisters, care of blisters and infections, and management of nutritional problems can be accessed through theNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin  Diseases(NIAMS) and article from theeMedicinejournal."
Malignant eccrine spiradenoma,"Surgery to remove as much of thetumoras possible is usually the first step of treatment for malignant eccrine spiradenoma.  Both a traditional surgical technique known aswide local excisionand the newerMohs micrographic surgeryare thought to be effective for treating thiscancer.  Additional treatment may includeradiation therapyto destroy any cancercellsthat might remain after surgery.  Thoughchemotherapyhas been used in cases of malignant eccrine spiradenoma, it is thought to be of limited help in treating this disease.[1]"
Progressive osseous heteroplasia,"At this time, there are no effective treatments or prevention for progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH). Surgery to remove diffuse lesions usually leads to recurrences or complications, but areas of well-circumscribed lesions can often be removed, with successful long-term results. Unfortunately, amputations are sometimes needed when there is severe growth retardation and functional ankylosis (locking of joints).[2]One case report on the use of the bisphosphonatepamidronatein POH suggested stabilization of the condition, but it is unclear how applicable this may be to preventing new skin lesions. Treatment with a bisphosphonate is unlikely to have an effect on preexisting bone formation.[2]Important conservative approaches includephysical therapyto preserve movement, and meticulous skin care to prevent the breakdown of skin.[2]Special shoes, braces, and other devices to assist in walking and weight-bearing have been used to help people with POH involving the lower limbs.[3]"
Ehlers-Danlos syndromes,"There is no specific cure for Ehlers-Danlossyndrome(EDS). The treatment and management is focused on preventing serious complications and relieving  signs and symptoms. Because the features of EDS vary by subtype, management strategies differ slightly.[7]For more specific information on the treatment of each subtype, please click on the links below:Hypermobility typeClassic typeVascular typeKyphoscoliosis typeArthrochalasia typeDermatosparaxis typePlease speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"The treatment of kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlossyndromeis focused on preventing serious complications and relieving signs and symptoms. For example,physical therapymay be recommended in children withhypotoniaand delayed motor development. This treatment can also help improve joint stability. Assistive devices such as braces may be necessary depending on the severity of joint instability. Depending on the severity of the kyphoscoliosis (kyphosisandscoliosis), surgery may be necessary. Because kyphoscoliotic EDS is associated with fragile skin with abnormal wound healing, affected people, especially children, may need to wear protective bandages or pads over exposed areas, such as the knees, shins, and forehead. Regular follow-up may be recommended to check for development or progression of abnormalities of the eyes, heart, and other parts of the body.[1][4]GeneReview'sWeb site offers more specific information regarding the treatment and management of kyphoscoliotic EDS. Please click on the link to access this resource.Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"The treatment and management of vascular Ehlers-Danlossyndrome(EDS) aims to relieve signs and symptoms and prevent serious complications. For example, people with vascular EDS havetissuefragility that puts them at high risk for rupturing of arteries, muscles and internalorgans. It is therefore important to seek immediate medical attention for any sudden, unexplained pain because emergency surgery may be needed. Pregnant women with vascular EDS should be followed by amaternal-fetal medicine specialistat a center for high-risk pregnancies.[4][2]Periodicscreeningmay be recommended to diagnoseaneurysmsor other problems that may not cause obvious symptoms. The risk of injury should be minimized by avoiding contact sports, heavy lifting, and weight training. Elective surgery is also discouraged.[2]GeneReview'sWeb site offers more specific information about the treatment and management of vascular EDS. Please click on the link to access this resource.Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"The treatment of  hypermobile Ehlers-Danlossyndromedepends on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example,physical therapyis often recommended to strengthen muscles and improve joint stability. Assistive devices such as braces, wheelchairs, or scooters may be necessary depending on the severity of joint instability. Pain medications may be prescribed to manage severe musculoskeletal (muscle and bone) pain. Affected people may be monitored for the development of osteopenia (lowbone density) and aortic root dilatation (enlargement of the blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body).[1][3][8]GeneReviews (see below) offers more detailed information regarding the treatment and management of hypermobile EDS.Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
Eosinophilic fasciitis,"About 10-20% of people with eosinophilic
fasciitis recover spontaneously without treatment.  For those who do
not, glucocorticoids (0.5–1 mg/kg/d), such asprednisone, are the
mainstay therapy. Even with treatment, improvement in symptoms can take
weeks or months. Glucocorticoids are successful in treating
eosionophilic fasciitis in over 70% of cases.[2]If glucocorticoids are
unsuccessful, methotrexate at low doses
(15–25 mg once weekly) is probably the most favored second-line
treatment, especially in people with reddish to purpleish (morphea-like) skin lesions.[3]Other treatment options include
NSAIDs, D-penicillamine, chloroquine, cimetidine, azathioprine,
cyclosporin A, infliximab, UVA-1, and bath PUVA.[2]Physical therapymay help improve joint mobility and decreasecontractures. Surgical release has been used in some severe cases to manage significant joint contractures.[4]"
Eisenmenger syndrome,"Older children with symptoms of Eisenmengersyndromemay have blood removed from the body (phlebotomy) to reduce the number ofred blood cells, and then receive fluids to replace the lost blood (volume replacement).Children may receive oxygen, although it is unclear whether it helps to prevent the disease from getting worse. Children with very severe symptoms may need a heart-lung transplant.[2]Adult patients with Eisenmenger syndrome should be seen by acardiologistspecializing in the care of adults withcongenitalheart disease."
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy,"Avoiding precipitating events such as alcohol use and sleep deprivation may be useful. However, medical therapy with anti-convulsants is typically needed and well tolerated. The majority of patients can be well-controlled on a single drug, most commonlyvalproic acid. Other medications that might be used separately or in combination includelamotrigine,levetiracetam,clonazepam, andtopiramate.[1][2]More details about the medications used to treat juvenile myoclonicepilepsyare available throughMedscape Referenceand theEpilepsy Foundation."
Elastoderma,"Due to the rarity of the condition, there is no standard therapy available for elastoderma. In some reported cases, the affected skin has been partially excised (removed). However, hyperlaxity of skin often returns following the surgery.[1][2][3]"
Glutaric acidemia type II,"The goal of treatment is to prevent long-term problems. However, children who have repeated metabolic crises may develop life-long learning problems. Individuals with glutaric acidemia type II should consult with a metabolic doctor and adieticianwho can help to develop an appropriate dietary plan. Some treatments may be recommended for some children but not for others. When necessary, treatment should be continued throughout the lifetime. The following treatments are often recommended:[4][5]Avoidance of fasting. Infants and young children with glutaric acidemia type II should eat frequent meals in order to preventhypoglycemiaand metabolic crises.A low-fat, low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet may be advised.Riboflavin,L-carnitineandglycinesupplements may be needed. These supplements help the body create energy.Alert the child's doctor if they should become ill, as illness can trigger a metabolic crisis."
Fibrocartilaginous embolism,"There is, unfortunately, no specific treatment for fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE). Management is generally focused on preventing possible complications and improving quality of life with medications andphysical therapy.[1]Treatments reported in the literature include surgery,steroid therapy,heparin administration, and/or blood pressure control. However, the benefits of these treatment options are not well-defined.[2][4]"
Extramammary Paget disease,"Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is usually treated by surgically removing the skin lesion. It is sometimes difficult to determine how much skin should be removed, particularly when lesions are spread throughout the anogenital region. Because recurrence is common, it is standard for patients to be re-examined every 3 months after surgery for the next 2 years. After 2 years, annual follow-ups are usually recommended.[1][2]In cases where surgery is not a possibility due to recurrence or location; treatment options reported in the medical literature with varying levels of success include: chemotherapeutic agents such as5-fluorouracil,imiquimod,paclitaxel,trastuzumab, anddocetaxelas well asaminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy,laser ablation, andradiation therapy. Unfortunately, studies regarding the effectiveness of the above treatment options are limited to mainly case studies and small literature reviews with limited follow-up.[1][2][3][4]Promising studies published recently include a study completed in Japan that reviewed the use of docetaxal as a first-line treatment in 13 individuals with EMPD withmetastasis. 12 individuals were found to have a response to treatment with a disease control rate estimated to be 83%. Another promising study reviewed the use of imiquimod in 10 cases of EMPD of the vulva. Complete clinicalremissionwas reported in 9 individuals. The remaining individual had partial remission.[3][4]There is an ongoing research study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of imiquimod in the treatment of EMPD.

Sturge-Weber syndrome,"Pulsed dye laser(PDL) remains the treatment of choice for the majority of children with a port-wine stain (PWS).[2]Laser treatment of port-wine stains may produce good cosmetic results, with a low incidence of adverse skin changes and other side effects.[3]A major benefit of laser treatment for a PWS is that it can help to minimize psychological problems associated with the social consequences of having a PWS. It has been shown that large facial port-wine stains are associated with an increase in mood and social problems in children older than 10 years of age.[2]Most experts agree that there is little risk associated with the use of PDL in a child with Sturge-Webersyndrome(SWS), provided that anticonvulsant therapy is maintained and that adequate care is taken. The level of pain associated with laser treatment varies. Management of anesthesia should be carefully planned to minimize the potential for secondary effects.[2]Few children with SWS achieve complete clearance of their PWS with laser treatment; PDL does have limitations when large areas or dermatomal patterns are involved.[2][3]"
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1,"People with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) are usually managed with regularscreeningto allow for early diagnosis and treatment of endocrinetumors. This screening begins in early childhood and continues for life.[2]Recommended screening includes specific types ofimagingstudies every 3-5 years:[2]Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan)begining at age 5.Abdominal computed tomography (CT scan)orabdominal MRI scanbeginning at age 20.Annual blood tests are also recommended, which evaluate the levels of certain substances that can be elevated if an MEN1-associated tumor is present:[2]Prolactinconcentrations, which can be used to screen for pituitary tumors, are measured beginning at age 5.Calciumconcentrations, which can be used to screen for parathyroid tumors, are measured beginning at age 8.Gastrinconcentrations, which can be used to screen for gastrinomas (a specific type of gastro-entero-pancreatic tract tumor) are measured beginning at age 20.When a tumor is detected through screening, the best treatment options depend on many factors, including the size, location, and type of tumor; and whether or not the tumor is ""functional"" (releasinghormones). Many tumors are treated with surgery. If a tumor is functional, removal of the affected endocrine gland often resolves health problems that may be present as a result of elevated hormones. In some cases, functional tumors can be treated with medications that block the function or lower the levels of the overproduced hormone.Chemotherapyorradiation therapymay also be used to to shrink or destroy tumors.[2][3]"
Goldmann-Favre syndrome,"While treatment options for complications such as,retinoschisisandcystoid macular edemamay be recommended, currently there is not a cure or specific targeted treatment for Goldmann Favresyndrome.[8][9]Laser photocoagulationmay benefit macular retinoschisis maybe because it results in the debridement of diseased retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)cellsand replacement by new cells decreasing the fluid within the macular cysts that could form in the disease.[4]Some improvement ofvisual acuityhas been reported after treatments withcyclosporin Aandbromocriptine.[10]Acetazolamide, 125 mg twice daily and topical 2%dorzolamidehave also worked for some patients with macular edema.[3][4]"
Eosinophilic cystitis,"Any possible causative factors, should be avoided or discontinued, such as certain medications (tranilast, mitomycin C). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such asaspirinoribuprofen, and antihistamines have been used as the primary management of choice with good results.Antibioticsare helpful, especially in those individuals with EC associated withurinary tract infections. Those who do not respond to NSAIDs and antihistamines have been treated withcorticosteroids. Corticosteroids and antihistamines are used because they suppress the inflammatory reaction in the bladder.[3]However, symptoms of EC may persist, despite steroid therapy. If symptoms persist after steroid therapy,azathioprineorcyclosporinecan be tried.[3]Other treatments includeintravesical dimethylsulfoxide, cyclosporin-A (immunosuppressant drug), and silver nitrate.[1]In those with bladder lesions, surgery has been successful. Few patients with progressive EC not responding to medical therapy or surgery may be considered for more radical procedures, such as partial/total cystectomy (surgical removal of all or part of the bladder).[1]"
Eosinophilic enteropathy,"There is no ""cure"" for eosinophilic enteropathy, but treatment can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment of eosinophilic enteropathy varies based on the location of the eosinophils, severity of symptoms, and other medical problems the child or adult may have. In most cases, dietary restrictions and medications can significantly improve the problematic symptoms of this condition.[2]Foodallergy testingis used as a guide for restriction or elimination diets. An elimination diet means strictly avoiding all foods to which the patient has tested positive on allergy testing. Skin and patch testing are used to guide elimination diets.[2]Sometimes a stricter diet, called an elemental diet, is needed. Skin and patch testing are used to guide elimination diets, but it only takes one false negative food for the diet to ""fail"". Elemental diets are diets that do not include whole or broken-down forms ofprotein. Instead, special elemental formulas are used, which are made ofamino acids(the building blocks of proteins), fats, sugars, vitamins and minerals. Amino acids do not cause allergic reactions but whole or partial proteins can.[2]Children and adults who rely in part, or completely, on an elemental amino acid based formula may have a difficult time drinking enough of the formula. To maintain proper nutrition, some require tube feedings directly into the stomach (enteral feeds). In the most severe cases, nutrition is administered directly into the blood stream (parenteral feeds).[2]TheAmerican Partnership for Eosinophilic Disordersprovides more information about treatment for eosinophilic enteropathy. This organization also provides more details onrestricted or elimination dietsandelemental diets."
Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis,"A variety of treatment options for eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) have been described with variable results.[3]Individualized therapy should be tailored to the type of EPF present.[5]The effectiveness of oralnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) is well established for many cases of classic EPF (more than 70%), but the reason why remains unknown. There are cases in which NSAIDs are not effective.[6]For cases of classic EPF, common NSAID options for treatment includeindomethacin(orally or topically) and acemetacin.Naproxenhas also been used with some success. For classic cases that are not responsive to NSAIDs, other treatment options include:[3][5]dapsonetopical and systemicsteroidsisotretinoinitraconazolepermethrininterferonantibioticsAdditional treatment options that may improve symptoms include:[3][1][5]narrowband UVB phototherapyultraviolet therapy withultraviolet Bor with ultraviolet APsoralen plus ultraviolet A(PUVA)calcineurin inhibitors such astacrolimus ointmentcolchicinetransdermal nicotine patchesThe infantile form tends to respond well to topicalcorticosteroidtherapy. It is important to recognize that this form typically resolves on it's own before age 3 in over 80% of cases, so observation or avoiding aggressive treatment is often recommended.[5]In people withHIV-associated EPF,antiretroviral therapytends to greatly diminish symptoms or even eliminate the condition.[3]"
Fibrolamellar carcinoma,"The standard treatment for fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is surgicalresection. Due to the rarity of the condition, there is limited information to support the use of other treatment options and there is no standardchemotherapyregimen. However, other treatments may be considered if surgical resection isn't an option. For example,liver transplantationmay be considered in patients who are not candidates for partial resection (removing a portion of the liver).[1][2]Medscape Reference'sWeb site offers more specific information on the treatment and management of FLC. Please click the link to access this resource."
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex,"There is no cure for any of the types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). Treatment of EBS typically involves supportive care to protect the skin from blistering, and the use of dressings that will not further damage the skin and will promote healing. Prevention of blisters may involve applying aluminum chloride to palms and soles to reduce blister formation;cyproheptadinemay be used to reduce blistering in some individuals with the Dowling-Meara type of EBS.Keratolyticsand softening agents for hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin) of the palms and soles may preventtissuefrom thickening and cracking. Prevention of secondary complications (such as infection of blisters) may involve treatment with topical and/or systemicantibioticsorsilver-impregnated dressingsor gels. Appropriate footwear andphysical therapymay preserve ambulation in children with difficulty walking because of blistering and hyperkeratosis. Surveillance is recommended for infection and proper wound healing. Avoiding excessive heat, poorly fitting or coarse-textured clothing and footwear, and activities that traumatize the skin is typically recommended.[6]Other treatments under investigation for epidermolysis bullosa includeproteintherapy andgene therapy.[7]"
Lafora disease,"Unfortunately, there is currently no cure or way to slow the progression of Lafora disease. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, certain medications may be recommended to managegeneralized seizures. In the advanced stages of the condition, agastrostomy tubemay be placed for feeding. Drugs that are known to worsenmyoclonus(i.e.phenytoin) should be avoided.[2][3]"
Episodic angioedema with eosinophilia,"Treatment may not be needed for episodic angioedema with eosinophilia (EAE), since symptoms usually resolve on their own. When treatment is initiated, steroids are usually the first choice. Certain medications used to treatcancer, includingImatinib(Gleevac) have also been successfully used in treating EAE.[4]"
MYH9 related thrombocytopenia,"There is currently no cure for MYH9-relatedthrombocytopenia. Measures that can be taken to prevent bleeding episodes may includeplatelettransfusion, desmopressin, or antifibrinolytic drug administration prior to surgery or invasive procedures, and regular dental care to prevent bleeding of the gums. People with MYH9RD should avoid drugs that inhibit platelet function or blood coagulation, activities with high risk for injury,ototoxicdrugs, hazardous noise, nephrotoxic agents (agents that are toxic to the kidneys),glucocorticoids(steroids) andradiation therapy. Bleeding episodes are treated with platelet transfusion and sometimes with desmopressin (this helps to shorten bleeding time in some people). People with bleeding episodes should be monitored foranemia. Once a year urine analysis (including 2-hourprotein) and a measurement of serum concentration of creatinine should be done to monitor forkidney disease. Hearing and vision evaluations are needed every three years prior to onset ofhearing lossandcataracts. Kidney complications, hearing loss, and cataracts are all managed in a standard fashion.[1]"
Wagner syndrome,"There is no cure for Wagnersyndrome, but there may be ways to manage the symptoms. Refractive errors (such as myopia) can be corrected by glasses or contact lenses.Cataractsshould be removed via standard protocols by an experienced eye care professional. Retinal breaks can be treated with laserretinopexy(gas bubble placement) or cryotherapy (use of subzero temperatures to treattissuedamage). All individuals with Wagner syndrome should be seen yearly a vitreoretinal specialist for an ophthalmologic evaluation.[2][4]More information about the management of Wagner syndrome can be found through theWagner Syndrome Website."
Erythema elevatum diutinum,"Dapsoneis the first line of treatment for erythema elevatum diutinum.[2][3]Other treatments which may be used include sulfapyridine,niacinamide, and intermittent plasma exchange (PLEXA). In rare cases, surgical treatment may be used to provide symptomatic relief.[2]"
Erythromelalgia,"There appear to be several subtypes of erythromelalgia, each responding to different therapies. Often it is necessary to try various treatments until the best therapy is found.[6]Patients respond quite variably to drug therapy, and no single therapy has proved consistently effective. Spontaneous remissions (going away without treatment) have also occurred.[1]Many types of drugs have been shown to be effective in relieving pain, including aspirin;misoprostol;serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitorsandselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors;gabapentin; sodium channel blockers;carbamazepine;tricyclic antidepressants;calcium antagonists;magnesium; sodium nitroprusside infusion; andcyclosporine.Other treatments may include:[1]cooling or elevating  extremitiestopical treatment withcapsaicin creamsurgical sympathectomy(a procedure where the sympathetic nerve fibers are selectively cut)epidural infusion of opiatesAvoidance of triggers (such as heat, prolonged standing, alcohol, and spicy foods) may reduce the number or severity of episodes.[6][1]"
Essential thrombocythemia,"Before starting the treatment, it is recommended to determine the risks of having complications according to the  age, medical history and the presence of specificmutationsto decide which the best treatment should be. The available treatments are not curative and do not prevent further evolution of the disease to acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis (which only happens in very rare cases). The treatment of essential thrombocythemia is based in reducing theplatelet countto avoid complications. The most common medication includehydroxyurea,interferon-alpha, Phosphorus 32,anagrelide. Aspirin in low doses can be used to control microvascular symptoms such as redness and pain in the fingers and toes, insufficient blood flow (ischemia), infections in the limbs (gangrene), strokes, syncopes, instability or visual disturbances.[4][10][1]The classification of the disease according to the risks is as following:[6]High-risk disease: People who had  thrombosis at any ageand/orwho are older than 60 years of age and have aJAK2 V617FmutationIntermediate-risk disease: People who are older than 60 years of age, who do not have aJAK2mutation and who never had thrombosisLow-risk disease: People who are 60 years of age oryounger, and who have aJAK2mutation and never had thrombosisVery-low-risk disease: People who are 60 years of age or youngerwithout aJAK2mutation and never had thrombosis.Recent studies have made the following recommendations:[6]People who have a high risk of thrombosis or who had thrombosis should use a cytoreductor in combination with an anticoagulantPeople with high or intermediate risk, should be treated with a cytoreductor in combination with aspirin at low dosesPeople who are at low risk should be treated with low doses of aspirin or are only observed carefully without any type of treatmentHydroxyurea is the preferred cytoreductive drug for most people, because it is less toxic and has a lower risk of producing myelofibrosis. However, in pregnant women and in those women who wish to become pregnant,interferonis used because  hydroxyurea or anagrelide may causebirth defects.[6][4]"
Olfactory neuroblastoma,"There are no standard guidelines for treatment of olfactory neuroblastoma. Treatment is dependent on the stage of thecancer. Most patients are initially treated with surgical removal of thetumorif possible.Radiation therapyis most commonly administered after surgery. The role ofchemotherapyfor olfactory neuroblastoma remains unclear. Although several studies have utilized chemotherapy, it is not clear whether it improves the long-term outlook (prognosis) compared to surgery and radiation therapy.[2][4]"
Hereditary hyperekplexia,"Hereditary hyperekplexia is commonly treated with the anti-anxiety and anti-spastic drugclonazepam. Other medications which have been helpful for some people includecarbamazepine,phenytoin,diazepam,valproate,5-hydroxytryptophan, piracetam,phenobarbital, andfluoxetine.[3][4][5][6]In some cases, a combination of treatments (i.e.clobazamand clonazepam) may be needed.[6][7]If fear of falling has limited a person's willingness to go outside their home and/or caused the development of a cautious walking style,cognitive behavior therapy(CBT) and/orphysical therapy, in combination with the medication to control the startle reflex and rigidity period, may help reduce anxiety, improve confidence in walking, and improve the person's quality of life.[3][4][5]"
Pelvic lipomatosis,"To date, weight-loss has not been shown to be effective in
managingpelviclipomatosis. Treatment options for pelvic lipomatosis
may include watchful waiting or surgery. Unfortunately, less invasive
treatments such asantibiotics, steroids, andradiation therapyare not
helpful.[2]Currently there are no well established treatment guidelines for pelvic lipomatosis. It can likewise be difficult to find doctors who have clinical experience  with this rare condition. The following
organization has a medical advisory board, physician
locator services, and patient networks which may help you find doctors
who are experienced in treating pelvic lipomatosis. While the group does
not offer information on pelvic lipomatosis currently,
they do advocate for all people with rare fat disorders.Fat Disorders Research Society2305 Robincrest LnGlenview,

Exercise-induced anaphylaxis,"Prevention remains the best treatment for patients with exercise-induced anaphylaxis.[1]Management should include education about safe conditions for exercise, identification and avoidance of offending foods, the importance of stopping exercise immediately if symptoms develop, the appropriate use of epinephrine, and the importance of having epinephrine available at all times. Patients may also be advised to wear a medical alert bracelet with instructions on the use of epinephrine.[1][2]The following factors may increase the risk of an exercise-induced attack and are often considered co-factors: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, certain phases of the menstrual cycle, temperature extremes, and seasonal pollen exposure.[2]As a result, patients may be advised to minimize their exposure to theserisk factors.[1]"
