Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Collecting duct carcinoma,"Treatment of collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) may include surgery to remove the kidney.Chemotherapymay also be given. The authors of a 2013 review article mentioned thatgemcitabineandcisplatinshould be considered the standard of care for chemotherapy treatment of metastatic CDC. This treatment regimen is similar to what is given fortransitional cell carcinoma, also known as urothelial carcinoma.Immunotherapywas not shown to be effective in treating CDC. There are a few reports of promising results fromtargeted therapysuch assunitiniborsorafenib. Studies are underway to learn more about these treatment options.[2]"
Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome,"Treatment of blue rubber bleb nevussyndromevaries depending on the severity and location of the affected areas. Skin spots do not usually require treatment, but some individuals with this condition may want treatment for cosmetic reasons or if the location of the nevus causes discomfort or affects normal function. Bleeding in the intestines may be treated with iron supplements andblood transfusionswhen necessary.[1][2][3][4]Surgery to remove an affected area ofbowelmay be recommended for repeated or severe bleeding (hemorrhage).[7]"
Becker muscular dystrophy,"There is currently no cure for Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and management aims to help with symptoms and improve the quality of life. Affected people are encouraged to remain active, because inactivity (such as bed rest) can make the muscle disease worse.[3]Physical therapycan help with stretching tight muscles and using assistive devices; occupational therapy can help with daily living skills; and speech therapy may help those withdysphagia(difficulty swallowing). Surgery may be needed for progressivescoliosisand development ofcontractures.[6]People with BMD should be monitored for orthopedic complications. Cardiac (heart) evaluations are recommended beginning at around 10 years old, or when symptoms first begin. Evaluations should be repeated at least every two years.[7]Some studies have shown that certaincorticosteroids(such asprednisoneor prednisolone) can slow the decline of muscle strength in people with Duchenne muscular dystophy; however, information about their use in people with BMD is limited.[7]There are a number of additional therapies for BMD being studied.[7]Potential future treatments for BMD may includegene therapy,exonskipping, ataluren, creatine, deacetylase inhibitors, myostatin inactivation, andcelltherapy (myoblast treatment, and/or the use ofstem cells).[6][8]"
Becker's nevus,"Becker's nevus typically does not require treatment except for cosmetic reasons - primarily excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) and hyperpigmentation.[3]Treatment has always been challenging, often using lasers with mixed results.[5]Q-switched ruby laserhas been used with variable success in the treatment of both the hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation.[3]Hypertrichosis may also be improved by laser-assisted hair removal or byelectrolysis.[1][2]Hyperpigmentation may be lessened withQ-switched Nd:YAG laserorfractional resurfacing, although responses are variable and recurrence rates are high.[1]Acne that develops within the nevus can be treated with standard acne therapies.[2]People with Becker's nevi should be examined for associated softtissueand bony abnormalities.[1]More detailed information about the treatment of Becker's nevus is available here on Medscape Reference's website. You may need to register to view this, but registration is free."
Behr syndrome,"Treatment is symptomatic. For instance, people who develop musclecontracturesmay have to undergo surgery."
Lymphocytic infiltrate of Jessner,"Lymphocytic infiltrate of Jessner may require no treatment (since it can resolve spontaneously), but some patients benefit from cosmetic camouflage, photoprotection, surgery to remove small lesions, use ofsteroidsorally or topically, antimalarial medications such ashydroxychloroquine,cryotherapy,methotrexate,thalidomide, and/or oralauranofin.[1][2]"
Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma,Surgery to remove the cystic lesions is the only effective treatment for BMPM. Aggressive surgical approaches are often recommended. Hormonal therapy has also been attempted in individual cases with variable degrees of success. Most affected individuals do not undergochemotherapyand/orradiotherapybecause thesetumorsare usually benign.[1][2]
Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE),"Usually treatment is not necessary because theseizureepisodes are infrequent and typically end by puberty. When episodes are more frequent or occur in the daytime, antiseizure medications, such ascarbamazepine,phenobarbital,phenytoin,valproic acid,clonazepam,clobazam,gabapentin, andlevetiracetammay be utilized. Most individuals respond to a low dose of a single drug; however rarely, a combination of different medications is needed.[3]"
Essential tremor,"Treatment for essential tremor may not be necessary unless the tremors interfere with daily activities or cause embarrassment.[3]Although there is no definitive cure for essential tremor, medicines may help relieve symptoms.[2][3]How well medicines work depend on the individual patient.[3]Two medications used to treat tremors include:[2][3]Propranolol, a drug that blocks the action of stimulating substances called neurotransmitters, particularly those related to adrenalinePrimidone, an antiseizure drug that also control the function of some neurotransmittersThese drugs can have significant side effects.[3]Eliminating tremor ""triggers"" such as caffeine and other stimulants from the diet is often recommended.Physical therapymay help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some patients.[2]More details about the management of essential tremor can be accessed through theMayo ClinicandMedscape."
Monomelic amyotrophy,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for monomelic amyotrophy (MMA). However, there are treatment options that can help manage symptoms of the disease and slow the progression ofmuscle weakness. If the doctors think that MMA is caused by compression of thespinal cord, they may recommend use of a brace that can be worn around the neck to prevent downward movement (flexion) of the neck. Other treatment options include muscle strengthening exercises and therapies to improve hand coordination.[1]Surgery for the treatment of MMA is debated, as there are benefits and risks associated with surgery.[5]People who are diagnosed with MMA will likely be recommended to see a neuromuscular specialist who can watch for progression of the disease.[2]"
Geographic tongue,"Because geographic tongue is a benign (harmless) condition and does not typically cause symptoms, treatment is usually unnecessary. Even those patients who experience sensitivity to hot or spicy foods, generally do not require treatment. With severe symptoms, topicalcorticosteroids, zinc supplements, and topical anesthetic rinses seem to reduce the discomfort in some patients.[2][3]"
Familial Mediterranean fever,"The goal of treatment forfamilialMediterranean fever (FMF) is to control symptoms because there is no cure for the condition.[6]Treatment of an acute episode may include:[5]intravenous saline for hydrationnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for fever and inflammatory episodesNSAIDs, paracetamol or dipyrone for pain reliefroutine treatment ofend-stage renal disease(kidney failure), includingrenal transplantationDepending on disease severity or the presence of specificmutations, lifelong treatment withcolchicinemay be needed.  Colchicine prevents  inflammatory attacks and the deposition of amyloid. Those who are only mildly affected (with infrequent inflammatory attacks) may either be treated with colchicine or be monitored every six months for the presence ofproteinin the urine (proteinuria). Others may only be treated with colchicine if they develop severe inflammatory episodes and/or proteinuria as a result of amyloidosis. Those who are unresponsive to oral colchicine may respond to intravenous colchicine, or one of several other medications. Colchicine is not effective as treatment for an acute FMF attack.[5]"
Schwannoma,"Treatment for a schwannoma may depend on the location of thetumor, severity of symptoms, and whether the tumor isbenignormalignant(cancerous).[6]A benign schwannoma causing symptoms or affecting a person's appearance is typically treated with surgery to remove as much as the tumor as possible, while keeping the affected nerve intact. It is often possible to remove the entire tumor. Surgery usually quickly relieves the related symptoms, although if muscle weakness was present before surgery, the muscle may not return to full strength.[2][6][10]Treatment for a malignant schwannoma may involve both surgery andradiation therapy.[2][6][10]"
Multiple symmetric lipomatosis,"To date, the most effective treatment for multiple symmetric lipomatosis is surgery which may includesurgical excision(removal) and/orliposuction.[6][7]Liposuction has gained popularity in more recent years since it results in minimal scarring. It is also considered less invasive, technically easier, and better suited for people with a higher surgical oranaestheticrisk.[7]Some researchers believe surgery is unnecessary because the disease usually does not lead tocancer. In their opinion, surgical excision should be limited to those with airway compression or severe physical deformities.[7]The limitations of liposuction include incomplete removal, risk of surgical mishap, and lipomas recurrence. The main disadvantage of surgical excision is the scarring; however, it offers the chance of more extensive ""debulking"" of affected areas, and less chances that the lipoma recur.[7][9]However, in many cases it is not possible to remove the lipomas completely, and they often recur after both of these procedures.[6][5][9]Also, there is no consensus about the best surgical approach. Bigtumorsare normally removed at various stages – it depends on the size of the tumor, coagulation problems, and impaired wound healing. In some cases, it is very difficult to prevent the bleeding during the surgery.  Liposuction is the least traumatic procedure, and therefore it is suggested as a complementary treatment.Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is useful for assessment as well as preoperative planning.[10][9]Some researchers have reported modest success treating the condition with the medication salbutamol, which increases the breakdown of fats. Abstaining from alcohol intake, weight loss, and correction of any associated metabolic/endocrine abnormalities are also recommended.[4][6][7]"
Tylosis with esophageal cancer,"Affected individuals may have periodicendoscopicand oral cavity evaluations by agastroentrologistto detect esophagealcancer.[1]For the palmoplantar keratoderma, adermatologistmay recommend oral retinoids such as etretinate,isotretinoin, andacitretin.[4]Topical therapies may include soaking in salt water and then gentle removal of deadtissue(debridement) and 50% propylene glycol in water under plastic dressing overnight weekly.[4]"
Horner's syndrome,"Treatment depends on the underlying cause. There is no specific treatment for Horner'ssyndromeitself.[1]In many cases, no effective treatment is known.[3]"
Best vitelliform macular dystrophy,"There is no specific treatment for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) at this time.[5][4]Low vision aids help affected people with significant loss of visual acuity.[6]Laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents such asbevacizumabhave shown limited success in treating some of the secondary features of BVMD such as choroidal neovascularization (when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and retina).[6][5][4]"
GM1 gangliosidosis,"There is currently no effective medical treatment for GM1 gangliosidosis.[3][4]Symptomatic treatment for some of the neurologic signs and symptoms is available, but does not significantly alter the progression of the condition.[4][7]For example, anticonvulsants may initially controlseizures. Supportive treatments may include proper nutrition and hydration, and keeping the affected individual's airway open.[3]Bone marrow transplantationwas reportedly successful in an individual with infantile/juvenile GM1 gangliosidosis; however, no long-term benefit was reported. Presymptomaticcord-blood hematopoietic stem-cell transplantationhas been advocated by some as a possible treatment due to its success in other lysosomal storage disorders.[4]Active research in the areas ofenzymereplacement andgene therapyfor the condition is ongoing but has not yet advanced to human trials.[4][7]Neurologic and orthopedic sequelae may prevent adequate physical activity, but affected individuals may benefit from physical and occupational therapy.[4]"
Sandhoff disease,"There is no specific treatment or cure for Sandhoff disease. Management is symptomatic and supportive. Supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and keeping the airway open. Anticonvulsants may be used to controlseizures.[2]There are current research efforts underway, including experimentalgene therapy, substrate reduction therapy, bone marrow transplants, andstem celltherapy.[7][8]Additional information about these investigational treatments for Sandhoff disease can be accessed through theNational Tay-Sachs & Allied Diseases Associationwebsite."
HIBCH deficiency,"Treatment of HIBCH deficiency involves frequent carbohydrate-rich meals, along with coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, and vitamin E supplementation.[5]People with HIBCH deficiency may also benefit from a low-valine diet withcarnitineandN-acetyl-cysteinesupplementation.[5]Prompt, supportive, treatment during periods of physical stress and viral illness is vital. This may involve frequent infusions of bicarbonate, plus additional supports as required.[5]We strongly recommend that these and other treatment options be carefully reviewed with a healthcare provider."
Bethlem myopathy,"The treatment for Bethlem myopathy is symptomatic and supportive. This means that treatment is directed at the symptoms of each affected individual. There is currently no cure for the disease, and there are no specific medications for Bethlem myopathy. In most cases,physical therapy, stretching exercises, braces, splints, and mobility aids such as a walker or wheelchair may be used to help people with Bethlem myopathy. In rare cases, surgery may be needed to help withjoint contracturesorscoliosis.[2]Clinical trialsare currently testing other possible treatments that could help slow the progression of symptoms of Bethlem myopathy.[4]"
Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome,"At the time of diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD)syndrome, acomputed tomography (CT)scan, or high resolutionCT scanif available, should be done to determine the number, location, and size of any cysts in the lungs.[3]There is no recommended management of the lung cysts.  Lung cysts related to BHD have not been associated with long-term disability or fatality.[4]The main concern is that the cysts may increase the chance of developing acollapsed lung(pneumothorax).If an individual with BHD experiences any symptoms of a collapsed lung - such as chest pain, discomfort, or shortness of breath - they should immediately go to a physician for achest x-rayor CT scan.[3]Therapy of a collapsed lung depends on the symptoms, how long it has been present, and the extent of any underlying lung conditions.[4]It is thought that collapsed lung can be prevented by avoiding scuba diving, piloting airplanes, and cigarette smoking.[4][5]Individuals with BHD who have a history of multiple instances of collapsed lung or signs of lung disease are encouraged to see a lung specialist (pulmonologist).[5]"
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,"It has been recommended that all people clinically diagnosed with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) receive treatment. Some individuals who have never had or demonstrated symptoms of CPVT, for example asymptomatic family members withCASQ2genemutations, may still benefit from treatment.[2]We recommend that you speak with your healthcare provider regarding your treatment options."
Kienbock's disease,"There is no complete cure for Kienbock's disease, but there are several nonsurgical and surgical options for treatment.[1]Treatment options depend on the stage of the disease (it progresses through four stages of severity), as well as the patient’s age, hand dominance, and ability to function.[4][1]The goals of treatment are to relieve the pressure on thelunateand to try to restore blood flow within the bone.[1]Stage I of Kienbock's disease (with symptoms similar to those of a wrist sprain) is typically treated conservatively, with noninvasive bracing and activity modification. This aims to reduce mechanical stress on the lunate bone.[4]Pain and swelling may be managed with anti-inflammatory medications.[1]Surgery is typically indicated for the later stages of the disease to reduce mechanical stress on the lunate, stop disease progression, and ideally facilitate restoration of blood flow.[4]The choice of procedure depends mainly on  how far the disease has progressed.[1]Surgical options may include:Revascularization - In some cases, particularly in early stages, it may be possible to return the blood supply to the lunate. This involves removing a portion of bone with attached blood vessels from another bone (usually a forearm bone or another hand bone), and inserting it into the lunate.[1]Joint leveling - If the two bones of the lower arm (radius and ulna) are not the same length, a joint leveling procedure may be recommended. A bone can be made shorter by removing a section of bone (as in radialosteotomy); a bone can me made longer using bone grafts (as in ulnar lengthening).[1]Proximal row carpectomy - In severe cases, the lunate can be removed. In this procedure, the two bones surrounding the lunate are also removed. This procedure can relieve pain while maintaining partial wrist motion.[1]Fusion - Nearby wrist bones can be partially or completely fused together to make one, solid bone. If the disease has progressed to severearthritisof the wrist, fusing all of the bones of the wrist to the radius will relieve pain and and improve hand function. However, all wrist motion would be eliminated.[1]Metaphyseal core decompression - In this procedure, the surgeon ""scrapes off"" part of the radius and ulna  without actually removing any osseoustissue.[4]Capitate-shortening osteotomy - A central bony wedge of thecapitateis removed, followed by fusing  the two remaining capitate bone segments.[4]Total wrist joint replacement (arthroplasty)[4]More information about the surgical treatment options for Kienbock's disease is available from Medscape Reference."
Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria,"There is no cure for bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP). Treatment is generally based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, medications may be prescribed to treatseizuresand/orepilepsy. People affected by BPP may also benefit fromphysical therapy,occupational therapyand/orspeech therapy.[3][1]Please speak with a healthcare provider for more specific information regarding personal medical management."
X-linked periventricular heterotopia,"Although there is no cure forX-linkedperiventricular heterotopia, there may be ways to manage the signs and symptoms  in each individual.Seizuresare typically treated with antiepileptic medications. Given the risk foraorticorcarotid dissection(leaking of blood into the artery wall), individuals with this condition may be advised to keepblood pressurewithin the normal range.Additionally, it is recommended that individuals with X-linked periventricular heterotopia undergo carotid and abdominalultrasoundsurveillance studies for aortic and carotid dissection andechocardiogramsto monitorvalvularabnormalities.[3]"
Primary Familial Brain Calcification,"There is no standard course of treatment for PFBC. Treatment typically addresses symptoms on an individual basis. Medications may be used to improve anxiety, depression,obsessive-compulsive behaviors, anddystonia.Antiepilepticdrugs (AEDs) can be prescribed forseizures.Oxybutyninmay be prescribed forurinary incontinence(loss of bladder control). Surveillance typically includes yearly neurologic and neuropsychiatric assessments.[1]"
Binswanger's disease,"The brain damage associated with Binswanger's disease is not reversible. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, medications may be prescribed to treat depression, agitation, and other symptoms associated with the condition. Successful management ofhypertensionand diabetes can slow the progression of atherosclerosis, which can delay the progression of Binswanger's disease.[1][2]"
Birdshot chorioretinopathy,"Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for birdshot chorioretinopathy.  Because this condition is rare, there are no established guidelines for treatment.  Treatment is determined based on the severity of each affected individual's symptoms.  Because birdshot chorioretinopathy is suspected to be anautoimmune disease, therapies aim to regulate the body'simmune response.  Therapies may includecorticosteroidssuch asprednisone(by injection or medication taken by mouth) or medications that suppress theimmune systemsuch ascyclosporine.[1][2]"
Black hairy tongue,"Although black hairy tongue normally resolves on its own, patients are encouraged to avoid the factors that have been shown to bring about hairy tongue. Treatment usually involves gentle cleaning of the tongue with a soft toothbrush. Medication is rarely prescribed for hairy tongue; however, in severe cases, antifungals, retinoids or mouthwashes may be used. If treatment fails, the affected portion of the tongue called the papillae (finger-like projections) may be clipped or removed using techniques such ascarbon dioxide laser burningor electrodesiccation (a procedure in which an electrical current is used to seal of the affected area).[4][1]"
"Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 1","Management of blepharophimosissyndrometype 1 requires the input of several specialists including a clinicalgeneticist, pediatricophthalmologist, eye plastic (oculoplastic) surgeon,endocrinologist, reproductive endocrinologist, and gynecologist.Eyelid surgery should be discussed with an oculoplastic surgeon to decide on the method and timing that is best suited for the patient. Traditionally, surgical correction of the blepharophimosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus (canthoplasty) is performed at ages three to five years, followed about a year later byptosiscorrection (usually requiring a brow suspension procedure). If the epicanthal folds are small, a ""Y-V canthoplasty"" is traditionally used; if the epicanthal folds are severe, a ""double Z-plasty"" is used. Unpublished reports have indicated that advanced understanding of the lower eyelid position has allowed for more targeted surgery that results in a more natural appearance.[5]For a general explanation of these procedures and to locate an eye-care professional visit theFoundation of the American Academy of Ophthalmologyand theNational Eye Institutewebsites. To locate a surgeon through the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic & Reconstructive Surgeryclick here.Generally, premature ovarian failure (POF) is treated withhormone replacement therapy. There is no specific treatment for POF caused by blepharophimosis syndrome type 1.Hormonereplacement therapy is generallyestrogenandprogesteroneand sometimes also includes testosterone. Birth control pills are sometimes substituted for hormone replacement therapy. Although health care providers can suggest treatments for some of the symptoms of POF, currently there is no scientifically established treatment to restore fertility for women diagnosed with POF. Women with POF are encouraged to speak to a health care professional. If you wish to obtain more information and support, you can visit theInternational Premature Ovarian Failure Association.[6]"
Bloom syndrome,"There is currently no cure for Bloomsyndrome, so treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. Because affected individuals are hypersensitive toDNA-damaging chemicals and ionizing radiation, standardcancertreatment plans often need to be adjusted for affected individuals. Changes may include reducing both the dosage and duration of the treatment; however, the cancers in affected individuals are often unusually responsive to treatment. The wide variety of types of cancer as well as the early development oftumorsin affected individuals make life-long cancer surveillance significantly important. Additionally, it is recommended that individuals avoid sun exposure to the face, particularly in infancy and early childhood. Treatment of diabetes is typically the same as for individuals in the general population.[2]"
Incontinentia pigmenti,"There is no specific treatment for incontinentia pigmenti. Treatment is aimed at addressing the specific symptoms seen in each individual. This might include standard management of blisters and skin infections, addressing dental problems and the associated speech and/or feeding problems, monitoring for retinal detachment and treating neovascularization with cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation, and addressing neurological symptoms such asseizures, muscle spasms or mild paralysis with medications or medical devices.[2][3][4]"
Burning mouth syndrome,"If the underlying cause of burning mouthsyndromeis determined, treatment is aimed at the triggering factor(s). If no cause can be found, treatment can be challenging. The following are potential therapies for burning mouth syndrome; we strongly recommend that you work with your health care provider in determining which therapy is right for you.[2]A lozenge-type form of the anticonvulsant medicationclonazepam(Klonopin)Oral thrush medicationsMedications that block nerve panCertain antidepressantsB vitaminsCognitive behavioral therapySpecial oral rinses or mouth washesSaliva replacement productsCapsaicinIn addition to these medications, the following measures may be helpful in reducing symptoms of burning mouth syndrome:[1]Sip water frequentlySuck on ice chipsChew sugarless gumAvoid irritating substances like tobacco, hot or spicy foods, alcoholic beverages, mouthwashes that contain alcohol, and products high in acid, like citrus fruits and juices, as well as cinnamon or mint."
Bone marrow necrosis,"Bone marrow necrosis is often associated withthrombocytopenia,anemia, low blood count (pancytopenia), and other complications that should be managed with supportive measures until the underlying disease is effectively treated. Once the necrosis stops, the bone marrowcellsare able to grow and thrive again.[4]"
Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia,"Most cases of BOOP respond well to treatment withcorticosteroids. If the condition is caused by a particular drug, stopping the drug can also improve a patient's condition.Other medications reported in the medical literature to be beneficial for individuals on a case-by-case basis include:cyclophosphamide,erythromycinin the form ofazithromycin, andMycophenolate Mofetil(CellCept). More research is needed to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of these potential treatment options for individuals with BOOP.In rare cases, lung transplantation may be necessary for individuals with BOOP who do not respond to standard treatment options.[2]"
Branchiootorenal syndrome,"Hereditaryhearing lossconditions, in general, tend to be managed by a team that includes anotolaryngologist, anaudiologist, a clinicalgeneticist, apediatrician, sometimes an educator of the Deaf, aneurologist, and in case of branchiootorenalsyndrome, anephrologist(kidney doctor). Treatment of hearing loss may include determining which aids would be most helpful, for example hearing aids or vibrotactile devices; cochlear implantation may be considered in children over age 12 months with severe-to-profound hearing loss. Early hearing intervention through amplification, surgery, or cochlear implantation may be recommended for children who are at risk to lose their hearing before they learn to speak.[2]People with hereditary hearing loss often require regular follow-up with a hearing specialist such as an audiologist to monitor stability or progression of the hearing loss.[2]Treatment of branchial fistulae or cysts may require surgery. For people with branchiootorenal syndrome and severe kidney malformations or complications,dialysisor kidney transplant may be required.[4]"
Buschke Ollendorff syndrome,"There is currently no cure for BOS. Surgical removal of lesions on or under the skin may be done for cosmetic purposes. In some patients, surgical treatment of deafness may be possible. Surgery might also be necessary for some of the signs or symptoms associated with BOS. Osteopoikilosis is typically asymptomatic, but about 15-20% of individuals experience pain and joint effusions (fluid build-up). Usually, no special restrictions in activity are required for individuals with BOS.[5]"
Fuhrmann syndrome,"The treatment recommended for people affected by Fuhrmannsyndromewill depend on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Some of the skeletal changes associated with Fuhrmann syndrome may be corrected with surgery. However, there are not surgeries available for all of the signs and symptoms associated with Fuhrmann syndrome.[4]"
Cornelia de Lange syndrome,"Because Cornelia de Langesyndrome(CdLS) affects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this condition varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. It may include:[4][5]Supplemental formulas and/orgastrostomy tube placementto meet nutritional needs and improve the growth delayOngoingphysical,occupational, andspeechtherapiesSurgery  to treat skeletal abnormalities, gastrointestinal problems,congenital heart defectsand other health problemsMedications  to prevent or controlseizures.The CdLS foundation'sWeb site offers more specific information about the treatment and management of CdLS.
