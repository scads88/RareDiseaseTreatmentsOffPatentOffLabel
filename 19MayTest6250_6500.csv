Synovial sarcoma,"The treatment of synovialsarcomadepends on the age of the person; the size and location of thetumorand the severity of the disease. The most common treatment is surgery to remove the entire tumor. In some cases,radiation therapyand/orchemotherapymay also be necessary before and/or after the surgery. When given before surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may reduce the size of the tumor, allowing lesstissueto be removed. These therapies may be given after surgery to reduce the risk ofrecurrence.[1][3]TheNational Cancer Institute'sWeb site offers more specific information regarding the treatment and management of synovial sarcoma and other forms of soft tissue sarcoma.

Syringoma,"People with syringomas have a variety of surgical treatment options, including high frequency electric current (electrosurgery) andlasersurgery. As individuals with syringoma usually do not have symptoms, treatment is typically considered cosmetic. The goal of treatment is to destroy thetumorwith little to no scarring or recurrence; however, syringomas may be located deep within the skin (dermis), therefore complete removal is often difficult and recurrence is common.[1][4]"
Tracheobronchomalacia,"TBM ideally should be managed by a team of specialists working together, which includes interventionalpulmonologists, radiologists, andthoracic surgeons. Treatment may only be needed if signs and symptoms are present, quality of life is impaired, and/or there is complete or near-complete collapse of the airway.[4]Initial management of symptoms may depend on whether an underlying condition is contributing to symptoms, and whether that condition can be managed.[1]In some cases, treating the underlying condition improves the symptoms of TBM.[8]Depending on severity, treatment options for TBM that continues to progress may include:[1][5][6][4][8]Silicone and/or long-termstenting.Tracheobronchoplasty - this is a surgical procedure used to stabilize the central airway by splinting the posterior wall of the trachea with mesh. The mesh becomes incorporated into the wall of the trachea and then stiffens. A person may be considered a candidate for this procedure depending on results of a short-term trial of stenting.Resection and reconstruction - this is a surgical procedure that may be used when TBD is more confined (focal).Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)- this has shown variable success and requires an external device which may interfere with daily activities.Tracheostomy- this may be used as a last resort and can sometimes worsen TBM.Even with treatment, continued surveillance is recommended to identify any progression or recurrence of symptoms.[4]"
Teratoma with malignant transformation,"Because teratoma with malignanttransformation(TMT) is quite rare, there are no established treatment guidelines.  In general, treatment often includes surgery to remove as much of the TMT as possible.Chemotherapythat is specifically designed to target the malignant part of the TMT may also be used.[2][1]"
Thalassemia,"The best treatment options depend on the severity of thalassemia. People affected by a mild form often need little to no treatment, while people with intermediate to severe thalassemias may require frequentblood transfusions, iron chelation therapy (treatments to remove excess iron from the body), and/orfolic acidsupplementation.[2][1]For more information on the treatment of thalassemia, pleaseclick here."
Thiopurine S methyltranferase deficiency,The National Institutes of Health ClinicalPharmacogenomicsImplementation Consortium isssued recommendations on how to manage patients with TPMT deficiency. They recommend that patients with one TPMTgenechange reduce thiopurine doses by about 30-70%. Patients with two TPMT gene changes should reduce thiopurine doses by at least 10-fold. The frequency of doses should also be reduced from daily to three times per week.[2]
Trigeminal neuralgia,"Treatment options include medicines, surgery, and complementary approaches.[3]Anticonvulsant medicines, which are used to block nerve firing, are generally effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia.  These drugs includecarbamazepine,oxcarbazepine,topiramate,clonazepam,phenytoin,lamotrigine, andvalproic acid.Gabapentinorbaclofencan be used as a second drug to treat trigeminal neuralgia and may be given in combination with other anticonvulsants.[3]Tricyclic antidepressants such asamitriptylineornortriptylineare used to treat pain described as constant, burning, or aching.  Typical analgesics and opioids are not usually helpful in treating the sharp, recurring pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia.  If medication fails to relieve pain or produces intolerable side effects, surgical treatment may be recommended.[3]Several neurosurgical procedures are available to treat trigeminal neuralgia.  The choice among the various types depends on the nature of the pain, the patient's preference, physical well-being, general health, previous surgeries, presence of multiple sclerosis, and area of trigeminal nerve involvement.  Some procedures are done on an outpatient basis, while others may involve a more complex operation that is performed under general anesthesia.  Some degree of facial numbness is expected after most of these procedures, and trigeminal neuralgia might return despite the procedure’s initial success.  Depending on the procedure, other surgical risks includehearing loss, balance problems, infection, and stroke.[3]Arhizotomyis a procedure in which select nerve fibers are destroyed to block pain.  A rhizotomy for trigeminal neuralgia causes some degree of permanent sensory loss and facial numbness.  Several forms of rhizotomy are available to treat trigeminal neuralgia:[3]Balloon compressionworks by injuring the insulation on nerves that are involved with the sensation of light touch on the face.Glycerol injectioninvolves bathing the ganglion (the central part of the nerve from which the nerve impulses are transmitted) and damaging the insulation of trigeminal nerve fibers.Radiofrequency thermal lesioninginvolves gradually heating part of the nerve with an electrode, injuring the nerve fibers.Stereotactic radiosurgeryuses computerimagingto direct highly focused beams of radiation at the site where the trigeminal nerve exits the brainstem.  This causes the slow formation of a lesion on the nerve that disrupts the transmission of pain signals to the brain.Microvascular decompressionis the most invasive of all surgeries for trigeminal neuralgia, but it also offers the lowestprobabilitythat pain will return.  While viewing the trigeminal nerve through a microscope, the surgeon moves away the vessels that are compressing the nerve and places a soft cushion between the nerve and the vessels.  Unlike rhizotomies, there is usually no numbness in the face after this surgery.Aneurectomy, which involves cutting part of the nerve, may be performed during microvascular decompression if no vessel is found to be pressing on the trigeminal nerve.[3]Some patients choose to manage trigeminal neuralgia using complementary techniques. This is usually done in combination with drug treatment.  For some, low-impact exercise, yoga, creative visualization, aromatherapy, or medication helps.  Other options include acupuncture, biofeedback, vitamin therapy, nutritional therapy, and electrical stimulation of the nerves.[3]More detailed information regarding the management of trigeminal neuralgia can be found through theNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and StrokeandMedscape."
Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency,"Treatment is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each person. Treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of specialists.Pediatricians,cardiologists,neurologists, and other healthcare professionals may need to systematically and comprehensively create a plan for each child's treatment.[4]Specific therapies may includeblood transfusionsto treathemolytic anemiaduring episodes ofred blood celldestruction (hemolysis) andassisted ventilationto treatparalysis of the diaphragm.Genetic counselingmay be of benefit for affected people and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[2]"
Transient global amnesia,"There is no specific treatment for transient global amnesia (TGA). Fortunately, this condition resolves on its own, typically within hours of onset.[1]Most people with TGA do not experience repeat episodes.[1][5]People with repeat episodes of TGA should document the circumstances triggering the event. For some, it may be possible to prevent TGA by avoiding triggers. However, for many this is not possible. Possible triggers of TGA include:[5][7]Sudden immersion in cold or hot waterStrenuous physical activitySexual intercourseMedical procedures, such asangiographyorendoscopyMild head traumaAcute emotional distress (e.g., from bad news, conflict or being overworked)Exposure to high altitudesMuch of what we know about treatment of recurrent TGA comes from single case reports. These reports emphasize the need to rule out all other possible causes of recurrent TGA type episodes, such as transient epileptic amnesia, vascular disease, heart conditions, and adverse drug events, as this will affect treatment.[8][9][10][11]The cause of transient global amnesia is not known, but migraines seem to be associated in many cases.  We found a single report of metoprolol use for treatment of recurrent TGA in a man with a history of migraine.[7]"
Transverse myelitis,"As with many disorders of the spinal cord, no effective cure currently exists for people with transverse myelitis. Treatments are designed to manage and alleviate symptoms and largely depend upon the severity of neurological involvement. Therapy generally begins when the patient first experiences symptoms. Physicians often prescribecorticosteroid therapyduring the first few weeks of illness to decrease inflammation. Although noclinical trialshave investigated whethercorticosteroidsalter the course of transverse myelitis, these drugs often are prescribed to reduceimmune systemactivity because of the suspected autoimmune mechanisms involved in the disorder. Corticosteroid medications that might be prescribed may includemethylprednisoneordexamethasone.[1]Chronic pain is a common complication of transverse myelitis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, others) — can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.[6]Bed rest is often recommended during the initial days and weeks after onset of the disorder.[1]Based on patient response and test results, additional therapeutic options may be added. Plasma exchange therapy is often used for those with moderate to severe transverse myelitis who don’t show much improvement after being treated with intravenous steroids.[4][5]This therapy involves removing the straw-colored fluid in which bloodcellsare suspended (plasma) and replacing the plasma loss with special fluids. It's not certain how this therapy helps people with transverse myelitis, but it may be that plasma exchange removesantibodiesthat are involved in inflammation.[5]Some patients respond very well to intravenouscyclophosphamide(a drug often used for lymphomas or leukemia). It is very important that an experienced oncology team be involved in the administration of this drug, and patients should be monitored carefully. Ongoing treatment with chemical agents that modify immune response (such asazathioprine,methotrexate,mycophenolateor oralcyclophosphamide) can be considered for the small subset of patients that experience recurrent transverse myelitis.[4]Individuals with permanent physical disabilities may benefit fromphysical therapy, occupational therapy and vocational therapy.[1]"
Trehalase deficiency,"There is no cure for trehalase deficiency. Treatment involves avoidance or restriction of foods that contain trehalose.[7][3]Trehalose is found naturally in mushrooms, algae, and insects.[6]Trehalose received the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a food additive in 2000.[9]Since that time, trehalose has been utilized in many capacities in food production due to its chemical makeup and properties including taste enhancement, food preservation, and stabilization against heat and cold. Food products that may contain trehalose or are predicted to contain trehalose in the future include: dried foods (cereal, powdered milk, beans), frozen foods, confection (candy, gum, chocolate), confectionary (cake, jam, cream), beverages (coffee, tea, fruit juices), and fermented food (bread, yogurt). Trehalose additionally might be utilized in medical and cosmetic products.[2][10][11]"
47 XXX syndrome,"There is no cure for 47 XXXsyndrome, and there is no way to remove the extraX chromosomethat is present in an affected individual'scells. Management of the condition varies and depends on several factors including the age at diagnosis, the specific symptoms that are present, and the overall severity of the disorder in the affected individual. Recommendations include:[4][6]Early intervention servicesfor infants and children that are diagnosed with the condition. Evidence suggests that children with 47 XXX syndrome are very responsive to early intervention services and treatment. These services may include speech, occupational, physical or developmental therapy, starting in the early months of life or as soon as needs are identified.Periodic screenings throughout childhood: Specific recommendations includedevelopmental assessmentby 4 months of age to evaluate muscle tone and strength; language and speech assessment by 12 months of age;  pre-reading assessment during preschool years; and an assessment of additional learning disabilities as well as social and emotional problems.Educational assistance. Receiving educational help to learn techniques and strategies to be successful in school and daily life.Supportive environment and counseling. Girls with triple X syndrome may be more prone to anxiety, as well as behavior and emotional problems. It is important to have a supportive environment and psychological counseling which may help teaching the family how to demonstrate love and encouragement, and discourage behaviors that might negatively impact learning and social functioning.Assistance and support in daily functioning. If there is developmental delays, this assistance and support may include help with activities of daily living, social opportunities and employment.It is also recommended that infants and children with 47 XXX syndrome receive kidney and heart evaluations to detect possible abnormalities. Adolescent and adult women who have late periods, menstrual abnormalities, or fertility issues should be evaluated forprimary ovarian failure(POF). Additional treatment for this disorder depends on the specific signs and symptoms present in the affected individual.[4]"
Undifferentiated connective tissue disease,"Although there is currently no cure for undifferentiatedconnective tissue disease, many affected people can find relief in medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which reduce the swelling in the joints. Your doctor may also recommend that you take pain relievers and avoid exposure to extreme temperatures to limit the symptoms you experience.[3]"
Urachal cancer,"Treatment for urachalcancerusually involves surgery to remove affected areas of the urachus, umbilicus (belly button), surroundingtissue, and all or part of the bladder (cystectomy). The role ofchemotherapyandradiation therapyfor the treatment of urachal cancer is unclear, although some studies show that chemotherapy can be useful in instances where the cancer spreads (metastasis) to other areas of the body and when the cancer returns after treatment (recurrence).[3][4]"
Urachal cyst,"Treatment of a urachal cyst may depend on whether or not the person is experiencing any symptoms. Sometimes these cysts are not treated  but are monitored, particularly if there are no symptoms. In some cases, the urachal abnormalities resolve on their own without treatment. Because there is a small risk that a urachal cyst may become cancerous,  surgery may be performed to completely remove theurachus. You can talk to your doctor about the risk of the urachal cyst causing infection or developing intocancerand balancing that with the risks associated with surgical removal.[1][4][5][3]"
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease,"Management of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease may involve various specialists includingdermatologists,ophthalmologists, andneurologists.[4]Experts agree that successful therapy for VKH disease involves early and aggressive treatment with systemiccorticosteroids(steroids).[1][4][5]Even when the symptoms of VKH disease get better with steroid therapy, many people need to slowly decrease the dose of steroid over a period of 3-6 months so that their symptoms do not return.[1]For people who don't respond to steroids or who cannot tolerate the side effects, a type of therapy that changes the response of the body'simmune systemcalled immunomodulatory therapy may be tried.[1]While there is increasing evidence supporting the use of immunomodulatory therapy in almost all people with VKH disease, there is ongoing research to determine exactly when this treatment should be started and who should receive it.[1][6]Surgery forglaucomais necessary in some people.[1]Other treatments for VKH disease are symptomatic and supportive.[5]You can view more detailed information about the treatment of VKH disease on Medscape's Web site."
VACTERL association,"Treatment for VACTERL association is based on the signs and symptoms present and may vary from person to person. It is best to work with your doctor to determine the signs and symptoms present and the available treatment options available for them. Care of people with VACTERL association may involve a team approach and include several different specialists, including agastroenterologist,cardiologist, surgeon,urologist, and more."
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis,"Management of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) focuses on preventing allergic attacks as well as relieving the signs and symptoms of the condition. It is often recommended that affected individuals try to avoid the agent that causes the allergy (if possible); wear dark sunglasses in the daytime; avoid dust; and stay inside on hot afternoons. Eye drops that affect the amount of histamine released byimmune systemcells(called mast cell stabilizers) may be used at the beginning of the season or at the first sign of a ""flare-up"" to prevent severe symptoms; however, they are not considered effective at relieving symptoms. Topical eye drops are generally preferred as the first source of treatment. Cold compresses, artificial tears, ointments and/or topical antihistamines may help. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may relieve symptoms in moderate cases; topical steroids are typically only used for more severe cases because long-term use can causeglaucoma.[2]A few prescription drugs may also be available for the treatment of VKC; these include cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide tromethamine and Levocabastine. Oral administration of montelukast, a drug usually prescribed for asthma, has also been shown to be an effective treatment of VKC.[2]For more information about these drugs and their availability, individuals should speak with their health care providers."
VLCAD deficiency,"Management of VLCAD deficiency depends on many factors, including the form of the condition and the specific signs and symptoms present. For example, people affected by the severe forms of the condition are typically placed on a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet with frequent meals. Supplemental calories may be provided through medium-chain triglycerides (MCT oil). If hospitalization is necessary for acute episodes ofhypoglycemiaand/ormetabolic crisis, intravenous glucose may be administered as an energy source. Periods ofrhabdomyolysismay be treated with hydration and alkalization of the urine (decreasing the amount of acid you take in) to protect kidney function and to preventacute kidney failure. Affected people are generally advised to avoid fasting, dehydration, and a high-fat diet.[1][2]"
Von Hippel-Lindau disease,"Treatment for Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease depends on the location and size oftumors. In general, the goal is to treat growths when they cause symptoms, but are still small so they don't cause permanent damage. Treatment usually involves surgical removal of tumors.Radiation therapymay be used in some cases. All people with VHL disease should be carefully followed by a physician or medical team familiar with the disorder.[4]"
Visual snow syndrome,"Unfortunately, there is no known cure for visual snowsyndrome. However, medications may reduce symptoms of the syndrome for some people. At this point, treatment options are based on what has been reported as being effective in single case reports or a small number of people. No one treatment is known to work for everyone with visual snow syndrome, and no studies have been completed testing the effectiveness and safety of the treatments.[1][2]Therefore, it is very important that a person with visual snow syndrome talks to their doctor about the benefits and risks of any treatment.Medications that may be prescribed include:[1][2]Anti-seizuremedication, such aslamotrigineGlaucomamedication, such asacetazolamideBlood pressure medication, such asverapamilMedications to prevent migrainesNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)such as ibuprofin (Advil), aspirin, and naproxen (Aleve)Using tinted contact lenses (colorimetric lenses) may help some people with the syndrome.[1][6]Because visual snow syndrome can be associated withanxietyordepression, it is important to speak with a doctor about proper treatments for these symptoms.[2][4]"
WHIM syndrome,"Early diagnosis and aggressive medical management are very important for individuals with WHIMsyndrome. Treatment of the condition currently includes G-CSF (a medication that stimulates the production ofneutrophils); intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for hypogammaglobulinemia;prophylacticantibioticsto prevent infection; and aggressive surveillance for, and treatment of, skin and mucosal HPV-related lesions. The dose of G-CSF should be determined for each individual, and adjustments may be needed periodically. IVIG has been shown to be effective at decreasing risk of infections, and it has also been reported that the hypogammaglobulinemia may improve following treatment with G-CSF. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in individuals affected with WHIM has not been specifically studied, but the benefits have been assumed based on studies on other types ofimmunodeficiencydisorders. Infections should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.[3]A new study sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases(NIAID) found that a drug called plerixafor, already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients undergoing abone marrow transplant, may also have promise for treating people who have WHIM syndrome. Plerixafor blocks the activity of CXCR4 (which is increased in affected individuals) and may become a targeted therapy for WHIM syndrome.  To read more about this ongoing study,click here."
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome,"The goals of treatment are to control symptoms as much as possible and to prevent progression of the disorder. Some people may need to be hospitalized initially to control the symptoms.[4]Wernickeencephalopathyis an acutesyndromeand requires emergency treatment to prevent death and neurologic problems. For this reason, even if the diagnosis is not confirmed, patients should be treated while additional evaluations are completed.[2][3]Treatment involves replacement ofthiamineand providing proper nutrition and hydration.[1][3]Intravenousthiamine is the treatment of choice. After the initial dose, daily doses of thiamine are usually recommended. Supplementation of electrolytes, particularly magnesium and potassium (often low in people with alcoholism), may be required in addition to thiamine. In those who are chronically malnourished, the remainder of the B vitamins should also be supplemented. Supplementation can be tapered as the patient resumes normal intake and shows improvement.[3]Because long-term alcohol use is the most common cause for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, avoiding alcohol provides the best chance for recovery. Referral to an alcohol recovery program should be part of the treatment regimen.[3]Due to difficulties with movement, patients should be provided with assistance when walking during the initial phase of treatment. Patients may requirephysical therapyto assist with movement. Walking difficulties may be permanent, depending on the severity at initial presentation and the timeliness of therapy.[3]Patients with Korsakoff syndrome rarely recover. Many patients require at least some form of supervision and social support, either at home or in a chronic care facility.[5]"
Xeroderma pigmentosum,"There is no cure for XP, but there are ways to prevent and treat some of the problems associated with it. Some of the strategies employed in the management of XP include:[2][3][4]Protection from ultraviolet lightFrequent skin and eye examinationsPrompt removal of canceroustissueNeurological examinationPsychosocial careSmall, premalignant skin lesions such asactinic keratosescan be frozen withliquid nitrogen. Larger areas of sun-damaged skin can be treated withtopical 5-fluorouracilorimiquimod. In rare cases, therapeuticdermatome shaving or dermabrasionis used to remove damaged superficial epidermal layers. Skincancerscan be treated using standard treatment protocols, including electrodesiccation and curettage (scrapes away the lesion and uses electricity to kill any remainingcells), surgical excision, or chemosurgery. High dose oralisotretinoinor acitretin can be used to prevent new cancers. Cancers of the eyelids,conjunctiva, and cornea are usually treated surgically. Corneal transplantation may be necessary for those with severe keratitis and corneal opacity.[2]More detailed information about the treatment of XP may be accessed through the following online resources:GeneReviews:ManagementMedscape Reference -Treatment&Medication"
"49,XXXXY syndrome","There is no cure for 49,XXXXYsyndrome. Treatment  depends on the symptoms present in each person and is often managed by a team of various specialists. Specialists involved in the care of an affected person may include heart doctors (cardiologists),orthopedists, physiotherapists,speech therapists, eye doctors (ophthalmologists),neurologists, andendocrinologists. While life expectancy is thought to be normal in the absence of major complications, affected people will need regular medical visits.[1]"
"48,XXXY syndrome","There is no cure for 48,XXXYsyndrome. Treatment depends on the symptoms present in each individual and is best managed by a team of specialists, includingcardiologists,orthopedists,speech therapists,neurologists, andendocrinologists. Life expectancy is generally normal in the absence of major complications. Regular medical visits are often needed, in particular to monitor problems withhormoneproduction, infections, and behavior.[1]"
"46, XY disorders of sexual development","As you can read in ourGARD webpages, the 46, XY disorders are a group of different conditions including 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis (Swyersyndrome), 46 XY, partial gonadal dysgenesis (Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome), ovotesticular DSD,  testicular regression syndrome (vanishingtestessyndrome) , Leydigcellaplaisa/hypoplasia, testosterone biosynthesis defects,  PORgeneabnormality, persistent Mullerian duct syndrome, 5 alpha-reductase type 2 deficiency and complete and partial androgen insensitivity syndromes.Therefore, several biologic factors such as genetic and hormonal influences contribute to gender identity, gender role behavior, and sexual orientation in humans, but this relationship is also modified by psychological, social, and cultural factors. Sex assignment of children with ambiguous genitalia remains a difficult decision for the families involved and subject to controversial discussion among professionals and self-help groups. Every case is unique and it is suggested that gender assignment should be based on clinical experience, study of the literature, and interviews with affected individuals.[3]In a large study recently published about women withcomplete androgen insensitivity syndrome(CAIS) it was found that they perceive themselves as highly feminine throughout development. Additionally, CAIS women largely report their sexual attraction, fantasies, and experiences were best described as female heterosexual. CAIS women unanimously reported satisfaction with being a woman (100%).[4]Another study with 46, XY individuals with androgen secreting testiculartissueand 46,
XX individuals withcongenitaladrenal hyperplasia concluded that androgen exposure may have some effect in higher brain function and the perception of the gender. The authors suggested that gender counseling should be part of the routine management for these patients to make sure that they are happy with being females.[5]The World Health Organization provides relevant information about gender and genetics in the following links:Genetic Components of Sex and GenderGender Assignment of Intersex Infants and ChildrenLegal Definitions of Gender"
Zika virus infection,"There is no vaccine to prevent Zikavirusinfections, nor is there a specific medicine to treat Zika.[7]Individuals infected with the Zika virus should get plenty of rest, drink fluids, and take medications such as acetaminophen for pain. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) should be avoided untildenguehas been ruled out.[7][8]In pregnant women with evidence of Zika virus in the blood or amniotic fluid, serial ultrasounds should be considered to monitor fetal anatomy and growth every 3-4 weeks. Referral to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist orinfectious disease specialistwith expertise in pregnancy management is recommended.[9]"
2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria,"There is still no established treatment.  However, for the D,L-2HGA type (combined type) some researches had used either malate or citrate. During malate treatment, urinary malate concentration increased, but beyond that, no effects were observed. In contrast, treatment with citrate led to some good results, but more studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this treatment.[3]"
