Primary carnitine deficiency,"Most individuals with primary carnitine deficiency are followed by ametabolic doctoras well as adieticianfamiliar with this condition. Certain treatments may be advised for some children but not others. Treatment is often needed throughout life. The main treatment for this condition is lifelong use ofL-carnitine, which is a natural substance that helps bodycellsmake energy. It also helps the body get rid of harmful wastes. L-carnitine can reverse the heart problems and muscle weakness caused by this condition.[3]In addition to L-carnitine, infants and young children with primary carnitine deficiency need to eat frequently to prevent a metabolic crisis. In general, it is often suggested that infants be fed every four to six hours. But some babies need to eat even more frequently than this. Many teens and adults with this condition can go without food for up to 12 hours without problems. Some children and teens benefit from a low-fat, highcarbohydratediet. Any diet changes should be made under the guidance of a metabolic specialist and/or dietician familiar with this condition. Ask your doctor whether your child needs to have any changes in his or her diet. Other treatments usually need to be continued throughout life.[3]Infants and children with this condition need to eat extra starchy food and drink more fluids during any illness, even if they may not feel hungry, because they could have a metabolic crisis. Children who are sick often do not want to eat. If they won’t or can’t eat, they may need to be treated in the hospital to prevent serious health problems.[3]"
Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 deficiency,"Treatment of CPT1A deficiency usually involves the support of ametabolic specialistand adieticianfamiliar with CPT1A deficiency. Treatment may differ depending on severity of symptoms and may be lifelong if necessary. Treatment may include:[3][2]Avoidance prolonged fasting/going a long time without foodIncorporation of a low-fat, highcarbohydratedietUse ofmedium Chain Triglyceride oil(special type of oil made up of medium chain triglycerides - a type of fatty acid)Children with CPT1A deficiency may require additional care during illness to avoid a metabolic crises. Call your healthcare provider should symptoms of an illness occur such as poor appetite, low energy or excessive sleepiness, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever.[2]"
Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency,"Treatment includes:[2][6][4]Strict avoidance of fasting: Infants and young children with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency need to eat frequently to prevent a metabolic crisis. In general, it is often suggested that infants be fed every four to six hours, although some babies need to eat even more frequently than this (every 3 hours). It is important that infants be fed during the night. They may need to be woken up to eat if they do not wake up on their own.A low long-chain fat diet andmedium-chain triglycerides(MCT) supplementation: The MCT formula should be as low as possible in C10 and C12 fatty acids because high dietary intake of these can lead to a metabolic crisis.Medium Chain Triglyceride oil(MCT oil) is sometimes used as part of the food plan for people with CACT deficiency.Administration of a highcarbohydratediet: Carbohydrates give the body many types of sugar that can be used as energy. In fact, for children needing this treatment, most food in the diet should be carbohydrates (bread, pasta, fruit, vegetables, etc.) andprotein(lean meat and low-fat dairy food).Supplementation withL-carnitin: A safe and natural substance that helps bodycellsmake energy and get rid of harmful wastes. However, its benefits are not yet determined.Administration of intravenous glucose: In cases ofhypoglycemia,hyperammonemia, and for the prevention of lipolysis (the breakdown of fat stored in fat cells) in the newborn, which may be lifesaving.Other treatment options for milder cases with some residual CACT activity may be the administration of statins and fibrates that have been shown to increase the amount of CACT.[4]When children get sick, parents should call the doctor. Children with CACT deficiency need to eat extra starchy food and drink more fluids during any illness (even if they may not feel hungry) or they could develop a metabolic crisis.[2]"
Caroli disease,"Treatment for Caroli disease and Carolisyndromeis based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, frequent episodes of bacterialcholangitiscan be treated withantibiotics. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation may be recommended in people withcholestasis. In severe cases of cholestasis, surgery (called a lobectomy) may be required. Stones that develop within the bile ducts may be dissolved with ursodeoxycholic acid or may require surgical removal, if feasible. In those withportal hypertension, medications may be prescribed to prevent bleeding and surgery to reroute blood flow (called portosystemic shunting) may be recommended in severe cases.[1][2]People who have recurrent infections, especially those who also have complications related to portalhypertension, may requireliver transplantation.[2]"
Tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica,"There is no specific treatment for tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica (TO). Recurrent infections and collapse of the lung are treated conventionally.[3]Inhaledcorticosteroidsmay have some impact on people in early stages of the condition, but whether they may be helpful for people with more advanced disease needs further study.[5]Occasionally,tracheostomymay be needed. Surgical treatment options may be considered when all conservative therapies have been unsuccessful. The long-term outlook (prognosis) for affected people is generally good, but usually depends on the extension and location of the lesions. It has been reported that over 55% of affected people do not have any disease progression following the diagnosis.[3]"
Cri du chat syndrome,"While there is no specific treatment available for cri du chatsyndrome, early intervention is recommended in the areas ofphysical therapy(achieving physical and motor milestones such as sitting and standing up), communication (speech therapy, sign language instruction), behavioral modification (for hyperactivity, short attention span, aggression), and learning (special education).[3]Because symptoms may vary from individual to individual, we recommend discussing these options with a health care professional to develop a personalized plan for therapy."
Cat eye syndrome,"Because cat eyesyndromeaffects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this condition varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example,congenital heart defects;anal atresia;cleft lip and/or palate; and certain skeletal abnormalities may require surgery. Children with delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) may be referred forphysical therapyoroccupational therapy. Special education services are often necessary for children withintellectual disability.[4][1][2]"
Catamenial pneumothorax,"Treatment of choice is with surgery, with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Conventional thoracotomy may be occasionally necessary, particularly in repeat operations. It is very important to examine the large, thintissuelining around the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest cavity (pleura).[1]Hormonal treatment with surgery prevents the repeat of catamenial and/or endometriosis-related pneumothorax. Gonadotrophin-releasinghormone(GnRH) for 6 to 12 months after the surgery is also often recommended.[1]"
Cerulean cataract,"No treatment is known to prevent ceruleancataracts, and there is currently no cure for the condition. Frequent eye evaluations and eventual cataract surgery are typically required to preventamblyopia(vision loss) as the opacities progress.[2]The symptoms of early cataracts may be improved with new eyeglasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses, or magnifying lenses. However, if these measures do not help, surgery is often the only effective treatment. Surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. Surgery is often considered when vision loss regularly interferes with everyday activities, such as driving, reading, or watching TV.[3]"
Galactosialidosis,"There is no cure for galactosialidosis. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive; for example, taking medication to controlseizures. Individuals with galactosialidosis are encouraged to routinely see theirgenetic counselors, neurological, ophthalmological, and other specialists as symptoms arise and to keep symptoms controlled.Bone marrow transplantis under investigation as an experimental therapy.[4][5]No conclusive results are currently available regarding the long term benefits of this treatment.[5]"
Cerebral cavernous malformation,"Seizuresare usually treated with antiepileptic medications.[1][3]If seizures don't respond to medication, there is recurring bleeding in the brain, or the lesions are in a surgically accessible location, surgical removal of the lesion(s) using microsurgical techniques may be recommended.[1][5]Headaches are managed symptomatically and/or prophylactically. Other neurological symptoms may be managed through rehabilitation.[3]"
Charles Bonnet syndrome,"While there is currently no single treatment that is effective for all cases of Charles Bonnetsyndrome, there are steps that patients can take that might have a positive effect:[1][5]Optimal eye care and regular visits to theophthalmologistLow vision aids to help maximize any existing visionAvoidance of conditions known to aggravate CBS such as stress, anxiety, social isolation, and sensory deprivationReassurance that the hallucinated images are benign and that treatment is an optionMedications includingolanzapine,quetiapine,carbamazepine,clonazepam, anddonepezilCertain rapid eye movements or blinking to help suppress the hallucinationRepetitivetranscranial magnetic stimulationTheCharles Bonnet Syndrome Foundationhas additional information."
Central core disease,"Treatments for central core disease (CCD) depend on the symptoms experienced by each affected individual.  When someone is first diagnosed with this condition, a physical examination is done to assess the extent and severity of muscleweakness, andphysical therapyandoccupational therapyassessments to determine which therapies might be most beneficial.  Physical therapy, such as stretching or low-impact exercises, may help improve weakness.  Some skeletal abnormalities can be addressed with physical therapy, though others may require surgery.  As the muscle weakness andscoliosisassociated with CCD can affect breathing, individuals diagnosed with this condition may benefit frompulmonary function tests.  If breathing is significantly affected, breathing exercises or other breathing support treatments may be recommended.[2]Another treatment option may be a medication called salbutamol, which was found to significantly increased muscle strength and stamina in six of eight children with CCD.[3]"
Cowden syndrome,"Because Cowdensyndromeis associated with an increased risk for certain types ofcancer, management is typically focused on high-risk cancerscreening. According to theNational Comprehensive Cancer Network2014, the recommended screening protocol for Cowden syndrome includes:[3]Cancer Screening for WomenBreast self examsbeginning at age 18Clinical breast exams every 6-12 months beginning at age 25**Annualmammogramandbreast MRIbeginning at age 30-35**Annual screening for endometrial cancer withultrasoundand/or randombiopsymay be considered beginning at age 30-35Prophylacticsurgeries may be considered as a preventative option for some forms of cancerCancer Screening for Men and WomenAnnual physical examination beginning at age 18**Annualthyroid ultrasoundbeginning at age 18**Baselinecolonoscopyat age 35 with follow-up every 5 years (more frequent ifpolypsidentified)Consider renal (kidney) ultrasound every 1-2 years beginning at age 40**or individualized based on the earliest diagnosis of cancer in the family.Pediatric (age <18 years)Yearly thyroid ultrasound examination** (on identification of aPTENpathogenic variant)Yearly skin check with physical examinationNeurodevelopmental evaluationIf there are not any symptoms, observation alone is prudent. Cutaneous lesions should be removed only if malignancy is suspected or symptoms (e.g., pain, deformity, increased scarring) are serious. When symptomatic, topical agents (e.g., 5-fluorouracil), curettage, cryosurgery, or laser ablation may offer temporary relief. [Hildenbrand et al 2001].GeneReviews offersmore specific information on the treatment and management of Cowden syndrome."
Majeed syndrome,"Treatment is based upon the symptoms present. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is treated withnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) andphysical therapyto avoiddisuse atrophyof muscles andcontractures. If CRMO does not respond to NSAIDs,corticosteroidscan be used short term to control CRMO and skin manifestations. Resolution of bone inflammation has been reported in at least two children who were treated with an IL-1 inhibitor.Congenitaldyserythropoieticanemia(CDA) may be treated withred blood celltransfusion.[2]"
Lattice corneal dystrophy type 1,"Treatment for lattice corneal dystrophy type 1 (LCD1) depends on the disease severity and the associated symptoms. Patching and soft contact lenses may be recommended for episodes of corneal erosion.Corneal transplant(i.e., penetrating keratoplasty) orphototherapeutic keratectomymay be an option for individuals with recurrent erosions and/or vision loss.[4][1]"
Celiac artery compression syndrome,"Surgery is currently the only treatment option for celiac artery compressionsyndrome. Surgery typically involves decompression of the celiac artery by dividing the fibers of the median arcuate ligament and celiac plexus (network of nerves in the abdomen). Surgical decompression might additionally be combined withstentplacement,angioplasty, or vascular reconstruction of the celiac artery.[1]"
Central pain syndrome,"Treatment of central painsyndrome(CPS) is known to be challenging.[4]The method of treatment may vary depending on the cause of the neurological damage. Pain medications (analgesics) often provide only some relief of pain.[4]In general, first-line management includes the use of tricyclic antidepressants such asnortriptyline, anticonvulsants such asgabapentin, or topical lidocaine. Second-line management involves the use of opioid analgesics such as tramadol, along with first-line medication. Third-line management may include other antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications.[5]Lowering stress levels appears to reduce pain.[2]Other treatment alternatives have included the administration of a sympathetic blockade (a type ofnerve block) and aguanethidine block, as well as psychological evaluation and treatment. Rarely, surgery is necessary.[6]Stereotactic radiosurgery of the pituitaryhas been used with some success.[4]Other forms of potential treatments that have been discussed in the literature includetranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(TENS);deep brain stimulation; andmotor cortex stimulation.[1][7]"
Cerebellar degeneration,"There is currently no cure for hereditary forms of cerebellar degeneration. In these cases, treatment is usually supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, a variety of drugs may be used to treat gait abnormalities.Physical therapycan strengthen muscles, while special devices or appliances can assist in walking and other activities of daily life.[3]In acquired (non-genetic and non-inherited) forms of cerebellar degeneration, some signs and symptoms may be reversible with treatment of the underlying cause.[8]For example,paraneoplastic cerebellar degenerationmay improve after successful treatment of the underlyingcancer. For alcoholic/nutritional cerebellar degeneration, symptoms are often relieved with discontinuation of alcohol abuse, a normal diet and dietary supplementation with thiamine and other B vitamins.[9]"
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis may be treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), which has been shown to normalize levels of cholestonal and improve neurologic symptoms. Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase may be used alone or in combination with CDCA. They are also effective in decreasing cholestanol concentration and improving clinical symptoms, however these treatments can lead to muscle damage. Coenzyme Q10 may improve muscle weakness, andcataractsurgery may also be required.[1]"
Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency,"Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is treated by supplementation with oral creatine monohydrate. By taking creatine orally, people with GAMT deficiency are able to supplement the amount of creatine in their systems so that the brain and muscles have more energy.[2]People with GAMT deficiency may also be on a diet that restricts their arginine orproteinintake. This is necessary so that the body creates less guanidinoacetate, which can result in the symptoms related to the buildup being less severe.[3]In order to allow the body to get enough nutrients with this diet restriction, people with GAMT deficiency may need to take a formula that has allamino acidsexcept arginine in it.[2]Doctors will recommend that people affected by GAMT deficiency be monitored closely to see how treatment is working for them. Treatment for GAMT deficiency can keep the symptoms of the disease from progressing, but treatment has not been shown to improveintellectual disabilityordevelopmental delay.[4][5]Treatment has been shown to help improve the coordination of movements and behavioral problems associated with GAMT deficiency.[6]Other forms of therapy that may help people with GAMT deficiency include speech,occupational, andphysical therapy. Behavioral therapy may reduce the behavioral symptoms of the disease as well.[2]"
Spastic diplegia cerebral palsy,"Treatment of spastic diplegia cerebral palsy varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and the severity of the condition. Affected people are often cared for by a team of healthcare providers who specialize in a variety of different medical fields (i.e.neurologists,rehabilitation physicians, social workers,physical therapists, etc). Orthotic devices (such as a walker, wheelchair or leg braces),physical therapy, andoccupational therapycan help improve independent mobility. Certain medications may be prescribed to relax stiff, contracted, or overactive muscles.Orthopedicsurgery is often recommended for severely affected people who have symptoms that make walking and moving difficult or painful.[1][3][5]For more information on the treatment of spastic diplegia cerebral palsy and other forms of cerebral palsy, please visit theNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stoke website."
Zellweger syndrome,"There is currently no cure or effective treatment for Zellwegersyndrome. Management is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, infants with feeding issues may require placement of afeeding tubeto ensure proper intake of calories. Care is usually handled by a team of specialists that may includepediatricians,neurologists, surgeons,audiologists(treat hearing problems),ophthalmologists(treat vision problems), andorthopedists(treat skeletal abnormalities).[5][1][6]"
Walker-Warburg syndrome,"There is currently no cure or treatment for Walker-Warburgsyndrome. Management is generally only supportive and preventive. Individuals who developseizuresare typically treated with anticonvulsants. A few children require surgical procedures, such asshunting for hydrocephalusor correction ofencephalocele.Physical therapycan be offered to aid in development or prevent worsening ofcontractures; however, the benefit of this has not been established. Feeding usually needs to be monitored and in some cases, a supplementalnasogastricorgastric feeding tubemay be necessary.[1]"
Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome,Treatment for COFSsyndromeinvolves supportive care and is based on an individual's symptoms. People with this condition often require a feeding tube to obtain adequate nutrition.[1]
Sneddon syndrome,"The optimal management of Sneddonsyndromehas not been established, and controlled trials have not yet been performed.[3]Currently, the most widely accepted treatment isanticoagulationwithwarfarin. Some suggest thataPL-negativepatients should follow a less aggressive approach consisting of antiplatelet therapy withaspirin, while others recommend warfarin with a higherinternational normalized ratiotarget.[2]Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitorshave been suggested to reduce endothelial proliferation (growth of the inside lining of the vessels), andprostaglandinto improve blood flow and gas exchange in small vessels (microvascular perfusion).[2]Abstaining from smoking and abstaining from usingestrogenoral contraceptives may prevent or decrease the severity of neurological symptoms.[3]While the use of immunosuppressive therapy appears generally ineffective, there are data indicating thatrituximabmay be effective in aPL-positive patients.[2]Additional research exploring the underlying causes of Sneddon syndrome may identify treatment options based on the cause in each affected person.[3]"
Klippel Feil syndrome,"There is no cure for KFS. Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the features and severity in each person, and can be life-long. Careful evaluation, consistent follow-up, and coordination with various specialists are needed to improve outcome and make sure that no related diagnosis is missed.[8]There are various conservative therapies available, including the use of cervical collars, braces, traction,physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and various pain medications.[1][9]However, for many people with KFS, symptoms are progressive due to degenerative changes that occur in the spine.[8]Surgery may be indicated for a variety of reasons, including persistent pain; neurologic deficits; cervical or craniocervical instability; constriction of the spinal cord; or to correct severescoliosis.[1]Some people with KFS may need surgery to repair other skeletal abnormalities, or those related to the heart, kidneys, ears, eyes, or other parts of the body.[9]Those at an increased risk for neurological complications should be regularly monitored by their health care providers and may be advised to avoid activities that could lead to trauma or injury to cervical vertebrae.[9]"
Congenital fiber type disproportion,"Currently we are not aware of new therpies, drugs, supplements, or vitamins to cure or effectively treatcongenitalfiber-type disproportion. Supportive treatment may involve orthopedic treatments, as well as physical, occupational or speech therapy.[2]You can find additional information on the management of congenital fiber type disproportion at the following link to the GeneReviews Web site. GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application ofgenetic testingto the diagnosis, management, andgenetic counselingof patients with specificinheritedconditions.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&part=cftd#cftd.Management"
Chandler's syndrome,"While it is not possible to halt the progression of Chandler'ssyndrome, theglaucomaassociated with this disease can be treated with medications and/or filtering surgery.[2][3][4]Eye drops used in managing glaucoma decrease pressure in the eye by helping the eye's fluid drain more efficiently and/or decreasing the amount of fluid made by the eye.[5]Drugs used to treat glaucomaare classified according to their active ingredient. These include prostaglandin analogs,beta blockers, alpha agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.[1][5]Combination drugs may be necessary for some patients.[5]If these medications do not successfully treat the glaucoma, surgery may be indicated.[1][5]Trabeculectomymay be used to treat glaucoma.[1][6]In some cases, multiple procedures may be necessary.[6]The corneal swelling associated with Chandler's syndrome may be treated through acornea transplant.[1][2]Further investigation is needed to determine the best way to manage this condition.[7]"
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F,"Treatment for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 mainly focuses on the specific symptoms present. Affected individuals are often managed by a team of various specialists that includesneurologists,physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical andoccupational therapists.Depending on the individual's signs and symptoms, the following may be indicated:[1]Special shoes, including those with good ankle supportAnkle/foot orthoses (AFO) to correctfoot dropand aid with walkingOrthopedic surgery to correct severepes cavusForearm crutches or canes for stability (fewer than 5% of affected individuals need wheelchairs)Treatment of sleep apnea or restless legsTreatment of pain and depression as needed"
Roussy Levy syndrome,"There is a lack of published information regarding the treatment for this condition specifically; however, as Roussy Levysyndromeis considered a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease resembling CMT type 1, the symptoms may be managed in a similar manner.[6]While there is no cure for CMT1, treatment is specific to the signs and symptoms present in each individual and may include:[9][10]Special shoes, including those with good ankle support and ankle/foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct foot drop and aid walkingOrthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus (high arches)Forearm crutches or canes for walking stabilitySerial night casting to help increase ankle flexibilityAcetaminophenornonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agentsfor musculoskeletal painAntidepressants or antiseizuremedications such ascarbamazepineorgabapentinfor neuropathic painBeta blockersorprimidonefor tremorsPhysical therapyand occupational therapyExercise within each individual's capabilityAdditionally, there are certain medications that are potentially toxic to people with CMT as they may worsen CMT symptoms.[10]The Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association (CMTA), an organization supporting CMT, maintains an updated list of medications that present varying risks for worsening CMT neuropathy. Clickhereto view their list."
Cheilitis glandularis,"The approach to treatment for cheilitis glandularis is typically based on information obtained from histopathologic analysis (microscopic examination of thetissue); the identification of the likely causes responsible for the condition; and attempts to alleviate or eradicate those causes. Given the relatively small number of reported cases of the condition, there is not sufficient or reliable data that exists with regard to medical approaches. Therefore, treatment generally varies accordingly for each individual.[1]For cases attributable toangioedema(swelling similar to hives beneath the skin), an antihistamine may help with temporary reduction of acute, nonpurulent (lacking pus) swelling.Suppurative cases (those with pus present) typically require management with appropriate antimicrobial treatment as determined by culture and sensitivity testing. Concomitantcorticosteroidtreatment may increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy in cases with nodularity; however, the potential adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid treatment, and because it can promote local fibrosis and scarring, limit its potential use either as an adjunct toantibiotictreatment or as a single therapeutic modality.Topical 5-fluorouracil is useful for treatment of dysplasticactinic cheilitisand to curtail its progression. In conjunction with clinical supervision, it can be prescribed as an alternative to vermilionectomy (sometimes called a lip shave) or as a preventative measure following vermilionectomy.[1]In cheilitis glandularis cases in which a history of chronic sun exposure exists (especially if the individual is fair skinned or the everted lip surface is chronically eroded, ulcerated, or crusted),biopsyis strongly recommended to rule out actinic cheilitis or carcinoma.Surgical excision is typically not necessary when the diagnosis is actinic cheilitis with atypia or only mild dysplasia; however, individuals require ongoing clinical vigilance at regular intervals and instruction in measures to protect the lips from further sun damage.Treatment options for cases of actinic cheilitis with moderate-to-severe dysplasia include surgical stripping or vermilionectomy, cryosurgery or laser surgery, or topicalchemotherapywith 5-fluorouracil. Given the potential for recurrence and the risk for development of carcinoma, sun protective measures and regular clinical monitoring should be instituted.In cases in which eversion, extensive fibrosis, and induration have resulted in lip incompetence with functional and cosmetic compromise, chronic pain, and surface disruption, surgical cheiloplasty (lip reduction) may be indicated to restore normal lip architecture and function. Cheiloplasty is also aprophylacticmeasure for reducing the risk of actinic injury.[1]"
Sialidosis type I,"There is no specific treatment for sialidosis. Management should be multidisciplinary and directed at supportive care and symptomatic relief. Overall health maintenance should be a priority, withseizurecontrol as necessary. Myoclonic seizures often respond poorly to treatment with anticonvulsant medications.[3][4]"
Uncombable hair syndrome,"There is no definitive treatment for uncombable hairsyndrome, but the condition usually improves or resolves on its own with the onset of puberty. Gentle hair care is generally recommended using conditioners and soft brushes, along with avoiding harsh hair treatments such as permanent waves (perms); chemical relaxants; or excessive brushing and blow drying. These strategies may improve the general manageability of the hair, although how well they work is subjective.[6]Another strategy that has been suggested to improve the appearance of the hair is the use ofbiotin supplements. One case report suggested significant improvement in hair strength and combability, with an increase in rate of growth after 4 months of supplementation.[6]"
