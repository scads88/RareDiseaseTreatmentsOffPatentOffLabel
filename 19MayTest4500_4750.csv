Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia,"Treatment of Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD) depends on the severity and individual symptoms in each person. Regular monitoring of the hips,  kidneys,immune systemand blood is recommended.[1]Examples of treatments that may be needed for SIOD include:[1]Kidneydialysisor transplantHip replacementTreatment of neutropenia with granulocytecolony-stimulating factoror granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorBone marrow transplantationfor immune deficiency (although several deaths after transplantation have been reported)Medications to suppress the immune system for those with autoimmune symptomsAcyclovirfor recurrent herpes infectionsImiquimodand cidofovir (an antiviral) for severe papillomavirusinfections of the skinAgents that improve blood flow or decrease blood clotting to treat transient ischemic attacks (""mini strokes"") or strokesStandard treatment of hypothyroidismStandard treatment ofscoliosis"
Leigh syndrome,"Treatment of Leighsyndromeis directed toward the specific symptoms present in each person.[6]Supportive care for Leigh syndrome includes treatment ofacidosis,seizures,dystonia, andcardiomyopathy, and attention to nutritional status.[4][3]Because anesthesia can potentially aggravate respiratory symptoms and bring on respiratory failure, careful consideration should be given to its use and close monitoring prior to, during, and after its use.[4][3]Progression and new symptoms should be monitored regularly (typically every 6-12 months). Evaluations with aneurologist,ophthalmologist,audiologist, andcardiologistare recommended.[4][3]Specific treatment is possible for the three nucleargene-encodedLeigh-like syndromes(milder conditions with similar features). These includebiotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease(BTBGD),biotinidase deficiency, andcoenzyme Q10 deficiencycaused bymutationof PDSS2.[4]"
Partington syndrome,"The treatment of Partingtonsyndromeis based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example,dystoniaof the hands and other parts of the body may be treated with a variety of therapies including medications and/orphysical therapy.[3]Speech therapymay be recommended for children withdysarthria. Medications may be prescribed to help prevent and/or control recurrentseizures. Children with mild to moderateintellectual disabilitymay benefit from special education services.For personalized information about the treatment and management of Partington syndrome, please speak to a healthcare provider."
Pars planitis,"The first approach to treating pars planitis iscorticosteroideye drops or injections near the eye to control inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, includingaspirin) or steroid medications (such asprednisone) can be taken by mouth. If these strategies are not successful, other medications may be given to reduce the body'simmune response(medications called immunosuppressants, such asmethotrexate).[2][3]If medications are not effective, surgery may be considered.Cryotherapyhas been performed in affected people to remove eyetissuethat has inflammation. Although this surgery has been shown to be effective in restoring clarity of vision, there are concerns that it may cause damage to other parts of the eye. Another surgery, known as vitrectomy, can be done to remove cloudy fluid (vitreous humor) from the eye.[6][2]"
Whipple disease,"The standard treatment for Whipple disease is a prolonged course ofantibioticsto destroy thebacteriathat cause the disease.[1][2][3]A number of different types, doses, and schedules of antibiotics may be used in an effort to find the best treatment.[2]A medicine calledceftriaxone2g, or penicillin G are commonly given intravenously as a first option. These antibiotics are typically followed by another antibiotic (such astrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) taken by mouth for up to 1 year. If symptoms come back during antibiotic use, the antibiotic treatment may be changed.[3]Depending on the seriousness of the disease, treatment may also include fluid and electrolyte replacement. Electrolytes are salts and other substances in body fluid that the heart and brain need to function properly.[2]Extra iron, folate, vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium may also be given to help compensate for the vitamins and minerals the body cannot absorb on its own.[2][3]People who are being treated for Whipple disease should be closely monitored by a health care provider because signs of the disease can return after therapy has been finished.[3]Full recovery of the small intestine may take up to 2 years, but the symptoms usually disappear in less time. Because relapse is common even after successful treatment, the health care team may continue to monitor the patient for many years.[2]In general, surgery is not needed, however, neurosurgical care is important for both obtaining diagnosticbiopsyspecimens in selected patients and placement ofventriculoperitoneal shuntingin patients withhydrocephalus.[6]"
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,"Surgery to completely remove the bile duct andtumoris the only option that can possibly lead to a cure for patients. The type of operation will depend on the size and location of thecancer. For cases of intrahepatic cancers that cannot be surgically removed, a liver transplantation may be an option. In some cases, a liver transplant might even cure the cancer. Finally, radiation andchemotherapyare also treatment options available for intrahepatic cholangiocarcioma either in addition to surgery or on their own.[2]"
Intravenous leiomyomatosis,"The mainstay of treatment for IVL is surgery to remove thetumorand its spread throughout the body. The use of anti-estrogentherapy, such astamoxifen, has also been suggested. Surgery requires the complete removal of the tumor, since incomplete removal may result in a recurrence and hence further surgery or even death. Many affected individuals undergo ahysterectomy; bilateraloophorectomyis also suggested because these tumors are estrogen dependent. Part of a tumor left inside thepelvicveins at the time of hysterectomy can extend towards the right side of the heart, leading to obstruction and other adverse events later in life. The median time between hysterectomy to the diagnosis of IVL with cardiac involvement is 4 years. Once there is cardiac involvement, a patient may require open-heart surgery to remove the IVL from the affected areas.[2][3]"
Systemic candidiasis,"Systemic candidiasis is usually treated with oral or intravenous (IV) antifungal medications, including echinocandin (caspofungin, micafungin, or anidulafungin)fluconazole, andamphotericin B. The specific type of medication and length of treatment will depend on many factors, including the age and health of the infected person, the location and severity of the infection, and the specific species ofCandidacausing the infection.[1][2][3][6]Antifungal medications may be given to certain high risk people in order to prevent the development of systemic candidiasis, however more studies are needed before it is clear if this practice is helpful.[2][6]For more information about the treatment of systemic candidiasis, please see theClinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Candidiasis: 2016 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America."
Isovaleric acidemia,"There is currently no cure for isovaleric acidemia (IVA). Upon diagnosis, immediate treatment is typically necessary in order to prevent metabolic crises and complications that may follow. It is often recommended that affected individuals have a low-leucine / low-proteindiet and use medical foods (such as special low-protein flours, pastas, and rice that are made especially for people with organic acid disorders) and leucine-free medical formula. A dietician with knowledge of IVA can help parents create a food plan that contains the right amount of protein, nutrients, and energy to keep the child healthy. Any diet changes should be under the guidance of a dietician. Medications that may be recommended includeglycineandL-carnitine, which help rid the body of unwanted isovaleric acid and other harmful substances. No medication or supplement should be used without checking with a metabolic doctor. Children with symptoms of a metabolic crisis need medical treatment right away and may be givenbicarbonate,glucose, and other medications by IV.[2]With prompt and careful treatment, children with IVA have a good chance to live healthy lives with normal growth and development. However, some children, even when treated, may have repeated metabolic crises which can lead to life-long learning problems or mental retardation.[2]"
Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome,"Treatment for linear nevus sebaceoussyndrome(LNSS) is directed towards the specific symptoms and severity in each affected person. Management may require coordinated efforts of a team of specialists that may consist ofpediatricians, pediatricneurologists,dermatologists,orthopedists,ophthalmologists, and other healthcare professionals.Those who are concerned about cosmetic appearance regarding the nevus might consider surgery to remove the nevus. Surgery used to be recommended due to the risk of becoming cancerous (malignant); however, the risk of malignancy is now much less than previously believed. Surgical removal of the nevus may not always be possible due to its specific location.Additional treatments depend on the specific abnormalities present and usually follow standard guidelines in the general population for these abnormalities. For example,epilepsymay be treated with anti-seizuremedications.[6]"
Spondylothoracic dysostosis,"There is no cure for spondylothoracic dysostosis. Treatment usually consists of intensive medical care, including early and aggressive treatment of respiratory infections,physical therapy, bone surgery, and orthopedic treatment.[6][7]Surgery may then be needed for chest wall or spine deformities, such as severescoliosis. An external bracing, for example, by use of an expandable prosthetic titanium rib may be used for some cases.[2]"
Johanson-Blizzard syndrome,"The treatment of Johanson-Blizzardsyndromefocuses on the specific symptoms that are present in each individual. Those with pancreatic insufficiency may requirepancreatic enzymesupplements (e.g., oral pancreatin) to promote proper absorption of fats and other necessary nutrients. Vitamin supplements may also be needed to prevent or treat vitamin deficiencies that may result from malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency. A special diet with easily-absorbed, high-proteinsupplements may also be prescribed to ensure that total nutritional requirements are met. Although these therapies usually lead to improved nutrient absorption and weight gain, most affected children still remain smaller and shorter than average for their ages. A surgery for pancreas removal (pancreatectomy) and withislet autotransplantation(TPIAT) should be used only as a last resort for patients with severe symptoms of pancreatitis.[3]Individuals withhypothyroidismmay need thyroxinehormonereplacement therapy. Other abnormalities such as craniofacial, genitourinary, cardiac, and/or other malformations associated with the condition may be treated with surgery. Dental abnormalities may be treated with bonding agents, use of dentures, and/or other techniques.Hearing lossmay be treated with hearing aids. Early intervention is important to ensure that children with JBS reach their full potential. Affected children may benefit from special remedial education, special social support, and other medical, social, and/or vocational services.[3]"
Stargardt disease,"At present there is no cure for Stargardt disease, and there is very little that can be done to slow its progression. Wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from UVa, UVb and bright light may be of some benefit. Animal studies have shown that taking excessive amounts of vitamin A and beta carotene could promote the additional accumulation of lipofuscin, as well as a toxic vitamin A derivative called A2E; it is typically recommended that these be avoided by individuals with Stargardt disease. There are possible treatments for Stargardt disease that are being tested, including agene therapytreatment, which has been givenorphan drug statusby the European Medicines Agency (EMEA, similar to the FDA).[5]You can read more about this treatment byclicking here. There are alsoclinical trialsinvolving embryonicstem celltreatments.[5]"
Juvenile retinoschisis,There is no specific treatment for juvenile retinoschisis. Low vision services are designed to benefit those whose ability to function is compromised by impaired vision. Public school systems are mandated by federal law to provide appropriate education for children who have vision impairment. Surgery may be required to address the infrequent complications ofvitreous hemorrhageandretinal detachment. Affected individuals should avoid high-contact sports and other activities that can cause head trauma to reduce risk of retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage.[1]
Multiple myeloma,"The treatment of multiple myeloma varies based on many factors including the age and general health of the affected person; the associated signs and symptoms; and the severity of the condition. In general, one or more of the following interventions may be used to treat multiple myeloma:[2][1][3]ChemotherapyCorticosteroidmedicationsTargeted therapyStem cell transplantBiological therapyRadiation therapySurgeryWatchful waitingTheNational Cancer Instituteoffers information regarding the management of multiple myeloma, including more specific information regarding the treatments outlined above.

Kawasaki disease,"Intravenous gamma globulin is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease and is administered in high doses. Children with Kawasaki disease usually improve significantly within 24 hours of treatment withIV gamma globulin(IVIG). Aspirin is often given in combination with the IV gamma globulin as part of the treatment plan in the beginning of the disease.[1]Additional treatments include glucocorticoids, which may reduce the level of inflammatorymarkersand fever more rapidly, and decrease the rate of initial treatment failure in certain high-risk patients.[3]You can read about theGuidelines for risk stratification of myocardial infarction in the long-term follow-up of children with Kawasaki disease, developed by the American Heart Association."
Keratoconus,"Treatment depends on the severity of the keratoconus symptoms and may include: :[4][5]Eyeglasses and contact lens: During early stages, vision can be corrected with eyeglasses. As the condition progresses, rigid contacts may need to be worn so that light entering the eye is refracted evenly and vision is not distorted. You should also refrain from rubbing your eyes, as this can aggravate the thin cornealtissueand make symptoms worse.Laser: Laser can improve corneal abrasions and contact lens tolerance.Implants: Keratoconus can also be treated with Intacs, which are small curved implantable corneal devices that can reshape the cornea. Intacs are FDA approved and can help flatten the steep cornea found in keratoconus.Collagen:Collagen cross-linkingis a new treatment that uses a special laser and eyedrops to promote “cross-linking” or strengthening of the collagen fibers that make up the cornea. This treatment may flatten or stiffen the cornea, preventing further protrusion.Corneal transplant: When good vision is no longer possible with other treatments, a corneal transplant may be recommended. This surgery is only necessary in about 10 percent to 20 percent of patients with keratoconus. In a corneal transplant, the diseased cornea is removed and replaced with a healthy donor cornea. A transplanted cornea heals slowly. It can take up to a year or more to recover good vision after corneal transplantation. Usually contact lenses are needed afterwards.Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty: With this procedure, only the front and middle layers of the cornea are transplanted. The benefits of this transplant over the “full” cornea transplant is a much faster healing period and less risk of rejection."
Palmoplantar keratoderma,"Treatment of both hereditary and acquired palmoplantar keratodermas (PPK) is difficult.[1]The goal of treatment is to soften the thickened skin and make it less noticeable.[2]In many cases, treatment only results in short-term improvement and often has unwanted side effects.[1]For people with acquired PPK, it is important to screen for systemic illnesses, infections, culprit drugs, and neoplasia (tumorformation). Treating the underlying condition or stopping possible triggers is the most effective treatment for acquired PPK.Treatment options may depend on the specific type of PPK a person has and may include:[1][2]Saltwater soaksEmollientsParing (cutting away layers of skin)Topical keratolytics(useful for people with limited keratoderma)Topical retinoids(this is often limited by skin irritation)Systemic retinoids (acitretin)Topical vitamin D ointment (calcipotriol)Surgery to remove the skin, followed byskin graftingPotenttopical steroidswith or without keratolytics in cases with an inflammatory componentPsoralens and ultraviolet A(PUVA) or re-PUVA (a combination of oral retinoids and PUVA) in some people with PPK secondary to psoriasis or eczemaCurrently, to our knowledge, there is no way to prevent PPK in a person who hasinheritedPPK but has not yet developed symptoms."
Tyrosinemia type 2,"The management of tyrosinemia type 2 revolves around dietary restriction of phenylalanine and tyrosine. This controlled diet typically lowers the blood levels of tyrosine, resulting in rapid resolution of the skin and eye symptoms. However, the effects of this controlled diet oncentral nervous systeminvolvement (mental development) remains unclear. In some cases, skin lesions may be treated with oral retinoids.[2]"
SCOT deficiency,"The treatment for SCOT deficiency is based on trying to avoid ketoacidotic crises, as these are the only times that symptoms of the disease occur. Because ketoacidotic crises occur when all of the glucose from a meal is broken down, it is important for people with SCOT deficiency to eat frequent meals with large amounts ofcarbohydrates. It is also important for people with SCOT deficiency to avoid eating food with high fat content. Doctors may recommend that people with the disease avoid high-proteinmeals as well. Individuals with SCOT deficiency can monitor levels of ketones in the urine in order to make sure they are not too high. Oral sodium bicarbonate supplements can be used in times of stress, such as an illness, to make sure that the body is receiving enough energy from other forms.[1]If a ketoacidotic crisis does occur, it is important that people with SCOT deficiency receive treatment right away. People with this disease typically respond well to IV infusions of glucose and sodium bicarbonate during times of ketoacidotic crisis.[1]"
Klebsiella infection,"The treatment ofKlebsiellainfections can be complicated since someKlebsiellabacteriaare resistant to certain types ofantibiotics. Once a person is diagnosed with one of these infections, a healthcare provider will usually order specialized laboratory testing (susceptibilitytesting) to determine which antibiotics may be used to treat theKlebsiellainfection. If the healthcare provider prescribes an antibiotic, it is important to take the medication exactly as instructed and to continue taking the prescribed course, even if symptoms are gone. If treatment  stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and the person may become re-infected.[1]"
Klinefelter syndrome,"Because symptoms of Klinefeltersyndrome(KS) can sometimes be very mild, many people are never diagnosed or treated. When a diagnosis is made, treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person, especially the problems related tohypogonadism,gynecomastia, and psychosocial problems.  Treatment may include:[1][3][4]Testosterone replacement:  About half of people with SK have low testosterone levels, which may be raised by taking supplemental testosterone. Having a more normal testosterone level can help affected people develop bigger muscles, a deeper voice, and facial and body hair, and may also increase sexual desire, enlarge thetestes, improve mood, self-image, and behavior; it may also protect againstosteoporosisand decrease the risks ofautoimmune diseaseand breastcancer.Breast removal or reduction surgery.Educational interventions: As children, many people with Klinefelter syndrome qualify for special services to help them in school. Teachers can also help by using certain methods in the classroom, such as breaking bigger tasks into small steps.Several forms of therapy such as physical, speech, occupational, behavioral, mental health, and family therapy can often help reduce or eliminate some of the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome such as poor muscle tone; speech and language problems; or low self-confidence."
MURCS association,"Some reproductive abnormalities may benefit from surgery.[3]Individuals with MURCS association do not typically havehormonedysfunction, sohormone therapymay not be beneficial.[4]"
Satoyoshi syndrome,"There is no cure for Satoyoshisyndrome, but treatments are available for the different symptoms a person may have. Medications that suppress theimmune systemmay be used to help prevent the immune system from attacking the body. These medications may includecorticosteroids.[1][2]Certain medications may work better for some people than others, so a doctor may have to try different medications to find the exact combination that works best for each person.[2]In some cases,plasmapheresishas been shown to help improve symptoms of people with Satoyoshi syndrome who have not responded to other treatment options.[8]"
Osteochondritis dissecans,"The primary aim of treatment for osteochondritis dissecans is to restore normal function of the affected joint, relieve pain and prevent osteoarthritis. Treatment for the condition varies depending on many factors including the age of the affected person and the severity of the symptoms. In children and young teens, osteochondritis dissecans often heals overtime without surgical treatment. These cases are often managed with rest and in some cases, crutches and/or splinting to relieve pain and swelling.[1][2][4]If non-surgical treatments are not successful or the case is particularly severe (i.e. the cartilage and bone are moving around within the joint space), surgery may be recommended. Following surgery,physical therapyis often necessary to improve the strength and range of motion of the affected joint.[1][2][4]"
Peters plus syndrome,"Treatment varies from person to person and is based on the extent of the disease. Once a person has been diagnosed with Peters plussyndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:[2]Eye examinationGrowthhormonetestingDevelopmental assessmentHeart examinationKidney examinationHead examinationThyroidtestingHearing assessmentAssessment by anophthalmologistevery three months or as indicated is recommended as well as regular developmental assessments. Preservation of vision in the affected eye(s) often requires surgery such ascornealtransplantation (penetrating keratoplasty).Certain medications, such ascorticosteroids, should be avoided, as they increase the risk ofglaucoma.[2]"
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,"While there is currently no cure for LAM, research has led to major progress in the treatment of symptoms, and diagnosing and understanding LAM. There are a number of treatments that may relieve symptoms or prevent complications from the disease. Treatments vary from patient to patient, depending on the severity of the disease. No all patients have the same response to treatment.[2][3]Medicines (e.g., diuretics,hormone therapy, bronchodilators that relax the muscles around the airways)Oxygen therapy - as lung capacity declines, supplemental or full-time oxygen therapy may become necessarySirolimus therapy - Rapamycin (sirolimus) blocks the pathway that is affected in LAMcells, which helps stop their uncontrolled growth. The use of sirolimus therapy may be considered in patients with moderate to severe LAM, or those with progressive disease.Procedures to remove air or fluid from the chest or abdominal cavities and prevent it from building up againProcedures to remove angiomyolipoma (AML), or benign kidneytumorsLung transplantation- a procedure to replace one or both lungs, this should be considered as a last resort due to the risk of serious adverse reactions, including major bleeding, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, long-term infections, and possibly painful scarring.Since LAM occurs almost exclusively in women of reproductive age, researchers believe thehormoneestrogenmight be involved in the abnormal muscle cell growth that characterizes the disease. Although there is no direct evidence that there is a relationship between estrogen and LAM, the treatment of LAM has focused on reducing the production or effects of estrogen. This could include estrogen or other hormone suppressing drugs. Additionally, doctors believe pregnancy may accelerate the progression of LAM. Women with LAM are urged to speak with a health care professional before getting pregnant.[3]"
Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy,"Physical therapy, including early mobilization, regular stretching and splinting, is the main focus of supportive care. Respiratory support and night-time ventilation often becomes necessary in the first or second decade of life. Prevention of chest infections may be achieved with the use ofantibiotics. Feeding difficulties leading to failure to thrive may be managed bygastrostomy. Surgery may be needed forcontracturesandscoliosis.[2][3]Some reports indicate that people with Ullrichcongenitalmuscular dystrophy may may benefit from cyclosporin A. More studies into the benefits of this therapy are needed.[3]"
Wallenberg syndrome,Treatment for Wallenbergsyndromefocuses primarily on relieving symptoms and rehabilitation. A feeding tube may be needed for severe swallowing problems. Speech and/or swallowing therapy may be helpful. Medications may be used to control pain.[1]Treatment may also depend on the underlying cause and/or how quickly it is identified.
