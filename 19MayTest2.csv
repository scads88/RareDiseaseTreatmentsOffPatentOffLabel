Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,"The treatment is basically done by giving theenzymealpha-1 antitrypsin (intravenous infusion of purified, human AAT) to prevent the progression of lung disease, aiming to increase the level of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the blood. Skin problems usually get better when the enzyme is given. It is recommended to avoid smoking and drinking.Other treatments include:[2][10233] [10251]Bronchodilatorsand inhaled steroids can help open the airways and make breathing easierLung volume reduction surgeryLung transplantationfor patients with advanced emphysema due to severe AAT deficiencyLiver transplantationfor patients with severe liver disease. After a liver transplant the AAT deficiency is corrected, because normal donor liver produces and secretes normal AATAntibioticsif there are infections.It is also recommended:[2]Vaccination against hepatitis A and BPreventive vaccines against influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.Ongoing research for other treatments include:[2][10233][10251]Gene therapyto replace the abnormalgenewith a normalSERPINA1gene (gene therapy) in the livercellsNasal spray with alpha-1 antitrypsinSynthetic inhibitors of human neutrophil elastase (intravenously and orally) which theoretically could provide protection against lung damageAntioxidant therapy with vitamins A, C and E and N-acetylcysteine for the treatment of emphysemaMedications to increase blood levels of AAT and decrease liver damage (Rapamycin and carbamazepine).Treatment with purified alpha-1 antitrypsin is indicated only when individuals:[2][10233]Are older than 18 years of ageHave levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin in blood that are less than 11 micromoles / literHave pulmonary function tests (spirometer ) that show airway obstructionDo not smoke or have stopped smoking for at least the last 6 monthsAre willing to be treated at the hospitalDo not have immunoglobulin A deficiency (because the therapy with alpha-1 may contain traces of immunoglobulin type A (IgA), and patients with IgA deficiency may haveantibodiesagainst IgA)In some cases it is also done in people who have normal airflow but who have aCT scanthat shows emphysema in the lung.Patients with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency should havelung function testevery six to 12 months. Liver function should be evaluated periodically in people with two abnormal copies of the Zallele(PI * ZZ). In cases of liver disease, liverultrasoundshould be done every 6 to 12 months to monitor for fibrotic changes and livercancer(hepatocellular carcinoma).[2]"
Amyloidosis AA,"Inamyloidosis AA, the treatment depends on the underlying disease. It is important to control the chronic infection or inflammatory disease which is responsible for the amyloid. Both surgery and medication can be used to achieve successful treatment outcomes for patients.Medscape Reference provides current and comprehensive information on medical treatment options for amyloidosis AA based on the underlying inflammatory disease or infection. Please visit the link below. You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free.http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/335559-treatment#showallKidney transplant is an important option in patients with amyloidosis AA in which stable control of the underlying disease has been achieved. However, appropriate patient selection is strongly recommended due to a higher incidence of heart failure and infections in AA individuals.[3]Currently there is aclinical studyon the safety and effectiveness of the medication KIACTA in preventing decline of renal function in patients with amyloidosis AA.CLICK HEREto learn more about this study including the six study locations within the United States."
Triple A syndrome,"There is no cure for triple Asyndromeat this time; treatment typically focuses on managing individual signs and symptoms of the condition.Glucocorticoid deficiency in individuals with knownadrenal insufficiency(present with Addison disease) is typically treated by replacement ofglucocorticoids. This may be important for avoiding an adrenal crisis and allowing for normal growth in children. In adult individuals, as well as those who have difficulty with compliance, replacing hydrocortisone withprednisoneor dexamethasone is sometimes recommended. It is usually recommended that affected individuals wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace and carry the emergency medical information card supplied with it.Achalasia is typically managed with surgical correction. Individuals may be monitored for pulmonary complications (due to reflux and aspiration). Gastric acid reduction therapy in individuals with reflux after surgical intervention is usually recommended. The symptoms in individuals with achalasia may be improved partially with pneumatic dilatation (also called balloon dilation). For those who remain symptomatic after this, other surgeries may be recommended.Alacrima is typically managed by applying topical lubricants (such as artificial tears or ointments), and with punctal occlusion (a procedure used to close the tear ducts that drain tears from the eye). The symptoms of alacrima typically improve with punctal occlusion. However, this procedure is usually only done when therapy with topical lubricants is unsuccessful.[1]"
Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency,"There is currently no cure for aromatic L-amino aciddecarboxylase (AADC) deficiency. Different medications can be used to help treat the signs and symptoms of the disease. However, although certain combinations of medications may help some people, there is no proven strategy that relieves the symptoms of all people with this disease.[3]Whether or a not a treatment works may depend on the exact change in theDDCgeneand how much the AADCenzymeis functioning in the body.[5]Since thenervous systemin a child with AADC deficiency does not have enough of certainneurotransmitters, the goal of many of the treatments is to make certain as much of these neurotransmitters are available as possible.[4]Medication could include any one or combination of the following:[4]Dopamine receptor agonistsMonoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitorPyridoxine (Vitamin B6)Other treatments may depend on the symptoms of each individual. These treatment options include:[4]Anticholinergic agentsto treat movement disordersSeizure medicationGastrointestinal medicationsMelatoninto treat sleep disturbancesPhysical, occupational, and speech therapy may also be helpful in improving symptoms of the disease.[2][4]Gene therapytreatment for AADC deficiency seems promising in mice with the disease (animal models),[6]andclinical studiesin humans are currently taking place to learn more about if the treatment is effective and safe."
Tangier disease,"To our knowledge there is no specific treatment for Tangier disease. Drugs known to increase high density lipoprotein levels in unaffected people, such as estrogens, nicotinic acid, statins, or phenytoin, do not work in people with Tangier disease.[2]To reduce the risk for heart and blood vessel disease, people with this condition should maintain a low fat (especially saturated fat) diet and overall healthy lifestyle. Heart diseaserisk factorssuch as smoking,high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, high level of triglycerides and homocysteine in the blood should receive prompt treatment. Fibrates can be used to help lower triglycerides.[2]To date, no treatment has been found to prevent the progression of this disease, including trials of omega-3-fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamin E.[2]Individuals with Tangier disease may benefit from referral to specialized lipid centers for advanced management. Consultation with the following specialists may be required:[3]LipidologistEndocrinologistCardiologistVascular specialistCardiovascular surgeonDietitian"
Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis,"Attenuatedfamilialadenomatous polyposis (AFAP) is generally managed with regularscreeningto detect if and when polyps develop.[2]Screening bycolonoscopyhas been recommended for affected people starting at age 20 to 25 years. People with polyps may undergo polypectomy (removal of polyps) followed by continued screenings every one to three years, depending on the number of polyps.[1]Aprophylacticcolectomy(removal of all or part of the colon) may be considered in people with too many adenomas to remove or those who cannot undergo screening.[3]About one third of people with AFAP have few enough colon polyps that screening with periodic polypectomy is sufficient.[1]Because individuals with AFAP can also developduodenaladenomas and othercancers,upper endoscopyis typically recommended starting at age 20 to 30 years and then every one to three years, depending on the number of polyps. There is currently no consensus on screening fortumorsthat occur outside of the colon, so it has been suggested that affected individuals are managed as if they have classic FAP.[3]A number of drugs such ascelecoxibandsulindacreportedly have been successful at reducing the number and the size of polyps in affected people, but these drugs generally help to prevent further complications and are not considered adequate treatment.[2]Additional and more detailed information about the treatment and management of FAP, including AFAP, is available on eMedicine's Web site and can be viewed by clickinghere."
Diamond-Blackfan anemia,"Some people have such mild signs and symptoms that they do not require treatment. In people who require treatment it may include:[3]Corticosteroids: Corticosteroid treatment is recommended in children over 1 year of age; this treatment can initially improve the red blood count in approximately 80% of people with Diamond-Blackfananemia.Prednisoneinitial dose is 2 mg / kg / day given orally once a day, at morning time.  After a month, if there is no improvment after a month the corticosteroids are tapered-of and suspendedBlood transfusions, which are given along with the corticosteroids or in people who do not get better with corticosteroidsBone marrow/stem celltransplantation: It is the only curative treatment for the anemia; however, patients should continue to be followed because they are at increased risk for leukemia andcancer. Results are better for children younger than ten years of age if transplanted using anHuman Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched sib"
Acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia,"Standard treatment guidelines have not been established for acquired amegakaryocyticthrombocytopenia. However, various immunosuppressive treatment approaches have been utilized in affected people. In several case reports, affected people were successfully treated withcyclosporineeither alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive medications (i.e. antithymocyte globulin). Other therapies for acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia have includedrituximab,danazol,azathioprine, andbone marrow transplantwith variable success.[1]To determine the best treatment for you or a family member, please speak with a healthcare provider."
Prune belly syndrome,"The initial evaluation of the newborn with PBS requires a team consisting of aneonatologist,nephrologist,urologistand in some cases other specialists (e.g.,cardiologist) as well.[4]Treatment options depend on the individual's age, health, medical history, extent of disease, tolerance for certain treatments or procedures, the expected course of the disease, and the parent's and/or guardian's opinions and preferences.In general, surgery may be done to repair abdominal muscle, genital, and bladder problems.Antibioticsmay be given to infants to treat or prevent urinary tract infections.[4][1][3]Timing of therapy may vary from patient to patient."
Sixth nerve palsy,"In some cases, sixth nerve palsy will disappear without treatment. If inflammation of the sixth nerve is suspected, medications calledcorticosteroidsmay be used. Until the nerve heals, wearing an eye patch can help with double vision. Prism spectacles can also help to realign eyesight. After a period of observation,strabismussurgery may be considered. Botulinumtoxinmay also be used to temporarily weaken the inward pulling of the muscle.[8][3][4]"
Spasmodic dysphonia,"The treatment for spasmodic dysphonia focuses on improving symptoms of the disease. Treatment options includespeech therapy,Botox injectionsinto the vocal cords, and surgery to try to fix the opening or closing of the vocal cords.[1][3]The exact treatment that will be available depends on the type of spasmodic dysphonia each affected individual has.[3]"
Schwartz Jampel syndrome,"Treatment of SJS aims to reduce muscle stiffness and cramping and may include massage, muscle warming, and gradual strengthening exercises. Medications might also be used and may include muscle relaxants and anti-seizuremedications, particularlycarbamazepine.Botoxmight additionally be used to relieve eye symptoms such asblepharospasm. If Botox is not successful in managing eye symptoms, a variety of surgical techniques have been found to be effective. When considering surgery as an option, an important consideration ismalignant hyperthermia, an associated complication, that can increase the risk of adverse outcomes.[3][7]"
Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt,"Becausecongenitalextrahepatic portosystemic shunts (CEPS) are rare, there are no guidelines for standard treatment of this condition.[2]Treatment is determined on an individual basis and depends on the type of CEPS.  In type I CEPS,liver transplantationis thought to be the only treatment.  Type II CEPS can be treated with surgery to close the connection between the hepatic portal vein and the hepatic vein, which would redirect bloodflow through the normal blood vessels within the liver.[1]"
Abetalipoproteinemia,"Anutritionistor other qualified medical professional should be consulted for specific dietary instruction in people with abetalipoproteinemia. Treatment involves very large doses of vitamin E, as well as large doses of vitamin supplements containing other fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements  are also recommended.[3][2]Several diet changes and/or restrictions are also needed to prevent stomach problems. A low-fat diet may help with digestive symptoms; medium chain triglycerides may be used (under supervision of a specialist) as a source of fat in the diet.[3]Management in adults typically focuses on specific complications associated with the disorder, and depends on the signs and symptoms present. Affected people may need consultations with several other types of specialists, including a lipidologist,gastroenterologist,hepatologist,ophthalmologist, andneurologist.[2]"
Asternia,"Asternia is treated with surgery.  Surgery may be recommended to prevent breathing difficulty and to protect theorgansin the chest, particularly the heart.[1][2][5842]  The type of surgery depends on the size of the gap between the ribs and the age of the affected individual.[2]Ideally, surgery consists of closing the gap by connecting the existing bones of the chest; this is best done while the affected individual is very young.[1][5842]  For older individuals or those with a wide space between the existing bones, surgery may include placing extra material (aprosthesis, made ofcartilageor bone from another part of the body orsynthetic/man-made materials) to fill the gap.[1][2]"
Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,"There is no standard treatment protocol for IBD deficiency. Infants diagnosed throughnewborn screeningare encouraged to work with ametabolic diseasespecialist and a dietician experienced in metabolic disorders. Some treatments may be recommended even if no symptoms have been observed. Treatment may be needed throughout life. The following treatments may be recommended for some babies and children with IBD deficiency.[3]Children with IBD deficiency may be helped by takingL-carnitine, a safe and natural substance which helps the body'scellsmake energy and get rid of harmful wastes. L-carnitine may also help to prevent or treat the heart problems andanemiaseen in children with IBD deficiency.Some infants and children with IBD deficiency may be advised to avoid fasting. Going without food for a long time causes the body to use its stores of fat andproteinfor energy. In some people with IBD deficiency, this may lead to the build up of harmful substances in the blood. Eating frequently (every 4 to 6 hours) may help to avoid these health effects.While most children with IBD deficiency do fine without a change in diet, a low-valine food plan might be necessary. Valine is found in all foods with protein. Foods high in valine, such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dried beans and legumes, nuts and peanut butter should be limited. There are medical foods such low-protein flours, pastas, rice, and special formulas that are made especially for people with organic acid disorders. Your dietician / physician can advise you on whether you should use these foods to supplement your child’s diet."
Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,Treatment of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency usually consists of avoidance of fasting and a low fat diet. Supplemental carnitine may be recommended for some affected children during acute crises. Episodes of acute metabolic acidosis may be treated with intravenous hydration with a solution containing 10% glucose which can reestablish an anabolic state. This can be followed by reintroduction of the patient's usual diet.[2]
Chorea-acanthocytosis,"There are currently no treatments to prevent or slow the progression of chorea-acanthocytosis; treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[2]Management may include:botulinum toxinfor decreasing the oro-facio-lingualdystonia; feeding assistance; speech therapy; mechanical protective devices; splints for foot drop;phenytoin, clobazam, andvalproateforseizuremanagement; antidepressant or antipsychotic medications; dopamine antagonists such as atypical neuroleptics or tetrabenazine; and standard treatment forcardiomyopathy. Surveillance includes monitoring of nutritional status and adaptation of diet to assure adequate caloric intake, cardiac evaluations every five years, andEEGevery third year.[3]"
Acanthoma,"Acanthomas are consideredbenign, but treatment may be done for cosmetic reasons or to relieve any associated symptoms.[2][3]Because acanthomas are quite rare, there are no established guidelines for treatment.  Treatment may depend on the type, number, and location of acanthomas.  For example, a single acanthoma may be removed by surgery, whereas multiple acanthomas may be treated withcryosurgeryor the use of the medicationfluorouracilcream.[2]"
Acanthosis nigricans,"There is no specific treatment for AN. Treatments are used mostly to improve cosmetic appearance and includetopical retinoids,  vitamin D creams (such ascalcipotriol),dermabrasionand laser therapy. Oral retinoid pills have also been used to treat AN, but are not used for most patients because of the multiple side effects and development problems associated with the treatment.
Treatment may also focus on trying to correct the underlying disease that causes AN to develop. Often correcting the underlying disease improves the skin symptoms.  Some steps that can be taken depending on the underlying disease include: correctinghyperinsulinaemiathrough diet and medication, losing weight with obesity-associated AN, removing or treating atumor, or stopping medications that cause AN.[2][3]"
Proud syndrome,"The treatment of Proudsyndromeis based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example,spasticitymay be treated with a variety of therapies including medications and/orphysical therapy.[4]Medications may be prescribed to help prevent and/or control recurrentseizures. Surgery may be required to treat certain physical abnormalities such as kidney or genital issues. Children with severeintellectual disabilitymay benefit from special education services.For personalized information about the treatment and management of Partington syndrome, please speak to a healthcare provider."
Accessory navicular bone,"If the accessory navicular bone is causing symptoms, activities may be restricted and a softer shoe may be recommended until the symptoms go away. If the symptoms persist, a specially and carefully made shoe support may be tried.  For people with accessory navicular bone who experience severe symptoms, surgery may be considered to remove the bony growth. Other treatments may include medications such asnonsteroidal anti-inflammatories(NSAIDs), immobilizing the area with a cast or boot, andphysical therapy.[4]"
Supernumerary nipple,"Most people do not need any treatment for a supernumerary nipple.[2]Removal via surgery or another technique may be considered for cosmetic purposes or if there are symptoms that cause discomfort, such as lactation or tenderness.[3]A thorough work-up for other malformations typically is not needed in a person with a supernumerary nipple who is otherwise healthy. However, a work-up may be recommended if a person has:[1]a supernumerary nipple accompanied by additional minor malformationsa prominent ectopic (abnormally-positioned) supernumerary nipplean establishedfamily historyof supernumerary nipplesPhysical exams andmammographyof ectopic breasttissueshould occur at the frequency recommended for normal breast tissue in any particular person.[1]Supernumerary nipples can undergo similar diseases to normal breast tissue.[3]"
ACDC,"Due to the rarity of this condition, there is very limited information available in the medical literature. We are not aware of specific treatment recommendations for ACDC, or of any therapies currently known to be effective. One affected individual reportedly was treated with surgeries to reroute blood flow through alternate vessels and had a joint amputation in the foot.[3]Several possible future therapies have been proposed.[1]Research is currently under way to investigate possible treatment options.The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through the National Library of Medicine, developedClinicalTrials.govto provide patients, family members, and members of the public with current information on clinical research studies.Click here to find trials relating to ACDC. This site may be checked often for new studies, as it is updated regularly."
Achondroplasia,"Recommendations for management of children with achondroplasia were outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Genetics in the article,Health Supervision for Children with Achondroplasia. We recommend that you review this article with your child’s health care provider(s). These recommendations include:[2]• Monitoring of height, weight, and head circumference using growth curves standardized for achondroplasia• Measures to avoid obesity starting in early childhood.• Careful neurologic examinations, with referral to a pediatricneurologistas necessary•MRIor CT of the foramen magnum region for evaluation of severehypotoniaor signs of spinal cord compression• Obtaining history for possible sleep apnea, with sleep studies as necessary• Evaluation for low thoracic or high lumbar gibbus if truncal weakness is present• Referral to a pediatricorthopedistif bowing of the legs interferes with walking• Management of frequent middle-ear infections• Speech evaluation by age two years• Careful monitoring of social adjustmentThe GeneReview article on achondroplasia also provides information on medical management.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1152/#achondroplasia.Management"
Idiopathic achalasia,"The aim of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter. Therapy may involve:[4][6][5]Injection withbotulinum toxin(Botox) to help relax the sphincter muscles (used as a temporary fix)Medications, such as long-acting nitrates (i.e.isosorbide dinitrate) or calcium channel blockers (i.e.nifedipine), to relax the lower esophagus sphincterSurgery (Heller myotomy) to decrease the pressure in the lower sphincterPneumatic balloon dilation of the esophagus at the location of the narrowing (done duringesophagogastroduodenoscopy)You can learn more about these treatment options by clicking on the following links:eMedicine Esophageal Motility DisordersMerck Manuals Motility DisordersA doctor should help to determine the best treatment for each individual situation.[4]"
Glycogen storage disease type 2,"Individuals with glycogen storage disease type 2 are best treated by a team of specialists (such ascardiologist,neurologist, and respiratory therapist) knowledgeable about the disease, who can offer supportive and symptomatic care.  The discovery of the GAAgenehas led to rapid progress in understanding the biological mechanisms and properties of the GAAenzyme.  As a result, an enzyme replacement therapy has been developed that has shown, inclinical trialswith infantile-onset patients, to decrease heart size, maintain normal heart function, improve muscle function, tone, and strength, and reduce glycogen accumulation.  A drug called alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme©) has received FDA approval for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type 2. Myozyme is a form of GAA—the enzyme that is absent or reduced in this condition. The drug is usually administered via intravenous infusion every other week. Myozyme has been remarkably successful in reversing cardiac muscle damage and in improving life expectancy in those with the infantile form of the disease.[1][3]To find out more information on Myozyme, please visit the following link:http://www.myozyme.com/. Another alglucosidase alfa drug called Lumizyme has also been approved for the treatment of this condition.[4]More information about Lumizyme can be accessed through the following link:http://www.lumizyme.com/patients.aspx."
Methylmalonic acidemia,"No consensus exists regarding the treatment of acute methylmalonic acidmeia or the chronic complications of this condition. In 2014, professionals across 12 European countries and the United States developed guidelines based on rigorous literature evaluation and expert group meetings that outline the current management recommendations and areas for further research. Visit the following link to access the proposed guidelines.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4180313/In general, methylmalonic acidemia is treated with a low-protein, high-calorie diet, certain medications,antibioticsand, in some cases,organtransplantation. Medication treatment consists of cobalamin (vitamin B12) given as an injection, carnitine and antibiotics. The diet is protein-restricted to limit the intake of isoleucine, threonine, methionine, and valine because these substances can turn into methylmalonic acid in an affected patient. Most patients also need to take a special formula created without certainamino acidsbut containing others to make sure they are getting enough protein for growth. Each patient's diet and medication regimen should be individually adjusted to meet their specific needs.[3]"
Hidradenitis suppurativa,"There is no known cure or a consistently effective treatment. Initial treatments may involve conservative measures such as warm baths, hydrotherapy, and topical cleansing agents to reduce bacterial loads. Acute painful skin lesions may be treated withcorticosteroids(e.g.,prednisone) or anti-inflammatory pills (e.g.,Celebrex,Advil,Naproxen, and others). Although not proven to be effective,antibioticsare often the mainstay of medical treatment, especially for lesions suspected of being super infected. Affected individuals may also be treated withoral contraceptivesor other medications that address a possible hormonal cause. Oral retinoids such asisotretinoinhave also been used. Other treatments that have been used with limited success includecisplatin,methotrexate, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, and TNF-alpha inhibitors.[1][5][7]In advanced cases, affected individuals may undergo surgery (e.g.,laser therapyorphotodynamic therapy), but recurrences of HS are not uncommon. Systemic therapies are still being researched. The goals of these therapies are to heal existing lesions and prevent the development of new lesions in the areas potentially affected by the disease.[1][5][7]"
Neurofibromatosis type 2,"People with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) are generally monitored periodically for the development of associatedtumorsand other health problems. This may include anMRIof the brain and spinal cord; hearing and speech evaluations; and an eye exam.[2][1]The treatment of NF2 depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example,vestibular schwannomasare typically slow-growing tumors so they may be observed for a period of time before treatment becomes necessary. When they begin to cause symptoms, vestibular schwannomas are usually treated with surgery and less frequently, withradiation therapy. Other tumors associated with NF2 are also treated surgically, althoughchemotherapyand/or radiation therapy may also be recommended in rare circumstances.[2][1]Hearing preservation and augmentation are also important in the management of people with NF2.[1]Medscape Reference'sWeb site offers more specific information on the treatment and management of NF2. Please click on the link to access this resource."
Landau-Kleffner syndrome,"The treatment for Landau-Kleffnersyndromemay vary depending on the specific symptoms present in each person. Children who haveseizuresmay be prescribed anticonvulsant medications andcorticosteroidsmay be recommended.[1]In some cases,immunotherapymay improve speech and seizures.[9]In rare cases in which other treatment options for seizures have not been successful, a surgery calledmultiple subpial transectionmay help to relieve seizures.[2]Speech therapy should be initiated as soon as possible to help children regain speech.[1]Speech therapistsmay also recommend helping children learnsign languageto help them find new ways to communicate.[4]Special educationmay also be necessary in some cases.[4]"
Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita,"Treatment of EBA may require a multidisciplinary team of doctors. Affected individuals with involvement of the gastrointestinal tract should be referred to agastroenterologist. Likewise, dentists andophthalmologistsshould be consulted for those with oral and ocular (eye) involvement. Medications used to treat EBA include oralcorticosteroids(such asprednisone), anti-inflammatory agents (such asdapsoneorcolchicine), and medications that suppress theimmune system(such asazathioprineorcyclophosphamide). Patients who are on long-term oral steroid treatment may be advised to take calcium, vitamin D, and, perhaps,bisphosphonatesto reduce the risk ofosteoporosisthat can be associated with steroid use.Extracorporeal photochemotherapy(photophoresis) has been shown to be effective in some cases. In patients who do not respond to other therapies, medications such asrituximabmay be considered. Patients with EBA should avoid contact sports and direct physical trauma to the skin whenever possible and may be instructed to use protective pads to cover skin surfaces when undergoing planned physical activities. Patients with oral involvement should avoid hard foods such as pretzels, nuts, and chips. Patients with EBA should be monitored regularly by physicians with experience in treating autoimmune skin disease. During the active disease stage, patients should be monitored on a monthly basis; when inremission, patients should be monitored annually.[5]"
SAPHO syndrome,There is no specific treatment plan for SAPHOsyndrome. It can be a chronic condition but sometimes eventually heals on its own. Joint pain may be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prescription vitamin A is used to treat the acne.Other drugs that may be used include:ColchicineTopical corticosteroidsSystemic corticosteroidsMethotrexateCalcitoninBisphosphonatesInfliximabEtanercept.[1]
Isaacs' syndrome,"The treatment of Isaacs'syndromeis based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, anticonvulsant medications such asphenytoinandcarbamazepinemay be prescribed to relieve stiffness, muscle spasms, and pain. Plasma exchange may provide short-term relief for people with some forms of acquired Isaacs' syndrome. Plasma exchange is a method by which whole blood is removed from the body and processed so that the red andwhite blood cellsare separated from the plasma (liquid portion of the blood). The bloodcellsare then returned to the patient without the plasma, which the body quickly replaces. If there is no response or poor response to plasma exchange, some studies suggest that intravenous infusions of immunoglobulins (IvIg therapy) may be beneficial.[1][3]"
Acquired pure red cell aplasia,"The main goals of treatment for pure redcellaplasia (PRCA) are to restore the production ofred blood cells, maintain adequate hemoglobin levels, and treat underlying disorders that may be causing the condition. The initial treatment plan typically includesblood transfusionsfor individuals who are severelyanemicand have cardiorespiratory failure.[2]PRCA due to medication or infections is usually reversible within a few months. Therefore, medications that may be causing the condition should be discontinued, and infections that may cause the condition should be treated.[2]Underlying conditions that may cause PRCA such as athymoma, hematologicalcancers, solidtumors, andsystemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) should be treated as necessary as well.[2]When the condition is idiopathic (of unknown cause) or due to anautoimmune disorder, PRCA is typically initially treated withcorticosteroids.[2]It has been reported that individuals who seem to be resistant to treatment may respond to a single course ofintravenous immunoglobulin(IVIG,) while others have responded to a single dose. In the United States, financial issues may make it difficult to obtain this treatment because IVIG is expensive and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat PRCA.[3]Additional and more detailed information about the management of acquired PRCA may be found on eMedicine's web site and can be viewed by clickinghere."
Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,"The treatment of PAP varies from case to case depending upon the form of PAP and the age of an affected individual and severity of the disease.  About one-third of individuals with idiopathic PAP (of unknown cause) will improve without treatment (spontaneousremission).Patients with moderate or severe respiratory problems due to autoimmune PAP can be treated by a whole lung lavage, a procedure in which one lung is cleansed with a salt solution while the other is pumped with pure oxygen. In some cases, the procedure may need to be performed once; in others it may need to be repeated many times over several years.[1]Generally, one lung is lavaged in the first procedure, followed by lavage of the opposite lung one to two weeks later.[1][3]A treatment using recombinant granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) given by nose, or with a subcutaneous injection is not approved for use in autoimmune PAP yet, but soon may be an effective option.[1][3][4]Lung transplantation has been used to treat adults with PAP as a last resort. According to the medical literature, in some cases, PAP has recurred in adults who have received lung transplantation.[1]Treatment options for patients with secondary and hereditary PAP are less clear and depend in part on the specific cause.In secondary PAP, removal and avoidance of the causative agent (e.g., silica exposure) or treatment of the underlying disorder may improve symptoms.[1]For neonates with severecongenitalPAP, lung transplantation is the only treatment that appears to improve outcome.[4][5]"
Acral peeling skin syndrome,"There is no cure for acral peeling skinsyndrome.[4][5]Treatment is centered on preventing skin damage and addressing symptoms as they occur.[5]Emollients are often used to reduce skin peeling.[4]If blister develop, they may be lanced with a sterile needle. Light dressings should be applied to prevent infection. The condition may be made worse by hot temperatures, high humidity, and friction. Individuals with acral peeling skin syndrome should avoid these condition, when possible.[5]Immersion in water should also be avoided.[4]Additional treatment information and tips for daily living are available through theInformation Leaflet for Parents/Carerswhich was developed by the Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust."
Apert syndrome,Treatment for Apertsyndromemay vary depending on the specific symptoms  in each person. Brain surgery may help to relieve the pressure created by thecraniosynostosis. A team of specialists may work with a child with Apert syndrome to plan other surgeries to help treat the facial abnormalities and the fusion of the fingers or toes. People with Apert syndrome will need to be closely monitored throughout life to treat any symptoms that arise.[4]
Nager acrofacial dysostosis,"In infants with Nager acrofacial dysostosis who experience respiratory distress require immediate attention and may require a tracheostomy.  A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure on the neck that opens a direct airway through an incision in the windpipe.Infants with feeding difficulties may require surgery and/or placement of a feeding tube (gastrostomy). Surgery can be performed to repaircleft palateand oftenmicrognathia. Cosmetic surgery, especially for eyelids, can be performed to ensure complete closure of eyelids at night in order to prevent injury of the cornea.[2]Surgical treatment is best accomplished at a craniofacial center with expertise in plastic surgery, otolaryngology, orthodontics, and dentistry.[4]Hearing aids for individuals withconductive hearing lossshould be offered.[2]"
Acromicric dysplasia,Treatment of acromicric dysplasia focuses on the specific signs and symptoms that are present in each individual; it is generally symptomatic and supportive.[3]Theprognosisfor affected individuals is good; no major complications appear to occur in the course of the disease and life expectancy is normal.[1]
Duane-radial ray syndrome,"The treatment of DRRS may vary and often requires a team of specialists. Severestrabismusassociated with Duanesyndromeand malformations of the hands and forearms may require eye surgery. Individuals with heart defects may also require corrective surgery. Hearing aids may be needed for those with hearing deficits. Growthhormone therapymay additionally be considered for individuals withshort stature. Since kidney issues may develop, renal monitoring should also be considered.[2]"
Guillain-Barre syndrome,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for Guillain-Barrésyndrome(GBS). However, symptoms of the syndrome can be improved with treatments includingplasma exchange therapyandimmunoglobulin therapy. Both of these therapies can help prevent theimmune systemfrom continuing to attack theperipheral nervous system.[1][3]In some cases,corticosteroidshave been used to try to alleviate symptoms of GBS. However, it has not been proven that steroids can help speed recovery.[3]People who have GBS may be admitted to the hospital for treatment and to reduce the risk of complications. In some cases, other treatments may be necessary to prevent complications of GBS including pain medications andheparinto reduce the risk ofblood clots. Some people with GBS may require help breathing with aventilator.[3]Physical,occupational, and speech therapy may be recommended to help people fully recover from GBS.[3]"
Parsonage Turner syndrome,"Treatment for Parsonage Turnersyndromevaries based on the signs and symptoms  in each person.Pain medications may be prescribed depending on the severity of the nerve pain. After the acute phase, different medications known as co-analgesics may be administered. These include gabapentin, carbamazepine, and amitryptiline. These drugs specifically treat nerve pain. Other techniques for pain management include application of heat or cold, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (a method of pain relief in which a special device transmits low-voltage electrical impulses through electrodes on the skin to an area of the body that is in pain).[1][2]Many people with PTS havephysical therapyand/or occupational therapy to maintain muscle strength and range of motion once the pain begins to subside. Surgeries such as nerve grafting or tendon transfer to restore movement and function to the shoulder muscles and joint may be considered if other treatment options are not effective.[1][2]"
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,"Treatment for ADEM aims to suppress inflammation in the brain. Treatment is usually comprised of anti-inflammatory medications. Most individuals respond well to intravenouscorticosteroids, such asmethylprednisolone. When corticosteroids fail to work,plasmapheresisorintravenous immunoglobulintherapy may be utilized.[1]"
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy,Treatment of acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) involves stabilizing the mother and delivery of the baby.[1][2][3]Detailed information about management of both mother and baby is available throughMedscape Reference.
Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis,"Left untreated, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis not associated with a more serious condition may disappear on its own within one to three months. Medications, such ascorticosteroids(prednisoneor prednisolone), can improve skin lesions and associated symptoms in just two or three days, with the worst of the lesions disappearing within one to four weeks. Doctors usually prescribe systemic corticosteroids (which are taken by mouth) to treat this condition. These  medications reduce redness, itching, swelling and allergic reactions.[1][4]If an underlying cause can be identified, it should be treated (i.e. surgical removal of solidtumors, treatment of infections, or discontinuation of  medications). Successful therapy of the underlying disorder may promote resolution of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis and prevent recurrences.[4]With or without treatment, the lesions rarely leave a mark or scar when they eventually disappear. Even after the lesions have resolved, treatment may continue, as recurrence of the condition is common.[1][4]"
Acute intermittent porphyria,"Treatment of AIP may vary based on the trigger of the attack and the symptoms present. Treatment may include stopping medications that cause or worsen the symptoms, treating any infections which may be present, administration of pain medication, monitoring fluid balance and/or correcting electrolyte disturbances, monitoring neurologic status and administering respiratory support. Mild attacks can be manged with increased caloric intake and fluid replacement. Recurrent acute attacks should be managed by a porphyria specialist.[2]Hospitalization is often necessary.[1]Panhematin, an intravenous medication used to correct heme deficiency, may also be prescribed.[3]More detailed information about the use of Panhematin for the treatment of AIP can be found byclicking here."
Lipodermatosclerosis,"Lipodermatosclerosis is primarily treated withcompression therapyto improvevenous insufficiency.[2]Other strategies for managing venous insufficiency include leg elevation; not sitting or standing in one place for long periods of time; regular exercise; and weight loss if overweight or obese.[3]Some affected people may require medications to prevent blood clotting; reduce pain and inflammation; and/or increase blood flow. Depending on the severity of the condition and the response to initial treatments, vein surgery may be recommended.[2]"
Acute respiratory distress syndrome,"Typically people with ARDS need to be in an intensive care unit (ICU).[1][2]The goal of treatment is to provide breathing support and treat the cause of ARDS. This may involve medications to treat infections, reduce inflammation, and remove fluid from the lungs. A breathing machine is used to deliver high doses of oxygen and continued pressure called PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) to the damaged lungs. Patients often need to be deeply sedated with medications when using this equipment. Some research suggests that giving medications to temporarily paralyze a person with ARDS will increase the chance of recovery. Treatment continues until the patient is well enough to breathe on his/her own.[1]More detailed information about the treatment of ARDS can be accessed through theNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute(NHLBI) andMedscape Reference.An article detailingOxygen Therapyis also available."
Marchiafava Bignami disease,"In individuals who have recovered from Marchiafava Bignami disease (MBD), it is not clear whether improvement was a result of vitamin supplementation or merely a reflection of the disease's natural history. Treatment should generally focus on nutritional support and rehabilitation from alcoholism (when alcoholism is present).[3]Various treatments, including those typically used for alcoholism in general, have been given to patients with MBD. Some have improved and some have not. The most common treatments are thiamine and other B vitamins (especially vitamin B-12 and folate, which is not a B vitamin but is commonly given with B-12). No specific proven treatment is available.[2]It has been recommended that individuals who survive the disease receive rehabilitation and, if appropriate, alcohol and nutritional counseling.[2]"
Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy,"The treatment of APMPPE is somewhat controversial, but the general consensus is that no treatment seems to alter the course of the ocular lesions. In cases complicated by subretinal neovascularization (growth of new blood vessels), laser photocoagulation may be useful.[1]In most cases, the lesions resolve spontaneously and no therapy is required. Some clinicians have usedcorticosteroids(which suppress inflammation) to treat the ocular findings and any severe systemic involvement. However, there is no evidence that treatment with corticosteroids affects the visual outcome.[1]The use of steroids has also been suggested when treating cases where the macula is involved.[7]Cycloplegics may be useful for severe iritis, which is an uncommon finding.[1]It is recommended that people with questions about treatment options for themselves or family members speak with their health care provider."
Acute promyelocytic leukemia,"Most cases of APL are treated with an anthracyclinechemotherapydrug (daunorubicinoridarubicin) plus the non-chemotherapy drug,all-trans-retinoic acid(ATRA), which is a relative of vitamin A. This treatment leads toremissionin 80% to 90% of patients.[6]Patients who cannot tolerate an anthracycline drug may get ATRA plus another drug calledarsenic trioxide.[6]Arsenic trioxide has also proven to be an effective alternative for the 20% to 30% of patients with APL who don't respond to initial treatment or who relapse. If treatment with arsenic trioxide achieves a remission, further courses of this drug may be given. Astem cell transplantmay also be an option. If a second remission is not achieved, treatment options may include a stemcelltransplant or taking part in aclinical trial.[7]Additional information related to treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia can be accessed throughMedscape. This includes detailed information related to the use ofarsenic trioxide."
Acute myeloid leukemia with abnormal bone marrow eosinophils inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22),"Acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML) is typically treated withchemotherapy, drugs injected into the bloodstream that target and destroycancercells.  The amount and type of chemotherapy used to treat AMML depends on the age and health of the affected individual.  The first step of chemotherapy for AMML isinduction therapy, treatment with drugs that aim to destroy the cancer cells in the bone marrow and blood.  Induction thearpy is followed by a rest phase to allow the affected individual to recover from the initial treatments.  Then, the second step of chemotherapy is given, calledconsolidation therapy, which should destroy any cancer cells that may remain in the body.[1]Stem cell transplantor participation in aclinical trialmay also be used to treat AMML if chemotherapy treatments are unsuccessful.[2]"
Rheumatic Fever,"Treatment of rheumatic fever usually consists ofantibioticsto treat the underlying group AStreptococcusbacterial infection and anti-inflammatory medications such asaspirinorcorticosteroids. Because people with a history of rheumatic fever have a high risk of developing recurrent episodes of the condition, low dose antibiotics are often continued over a long period of time to prevent recurrence.[1][2][3][6]"
Canavan disease,"Canavan disease causes progressive brain atrophy. There is no cure, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[2][3]Management may include provision of adequate nutrition and hydration, treatment ofinfectious diseases, and protection of the airway.Physical therapymay help to minimizecontracturesand maximize motor abilities and seating posture. Special education programs can enhance communication skills.Seizuresare treated with anti-epileptic drugs.Gastrostomycan help to maintain adequate food intake and hydration when swallowing difficulties exist.[4]"
"Early-onset, autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease","Unfortunately, there is no cure for Alzheimer disease in general; however, there are medications that may assist in temporarily helping with memory and thinking problems, such asExelon,Galantamine, andAricept. Physical and occupational therapy can be helpful in managing problems with walking and activities of daily living. Depression andseizuresmay be treated with appropriate medications.[1]"
Adenosine deaminase deficiency,"The treatment of adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) usually consists of the following:[2]Early diagnosis and therapy for bacterial, viral, and fungal infectionsProphylacticmedications for certain types of pneumoniaIntravenous (IV) immunoglobulinto boost the body's natural response to infectionsIt is also important to restore the function of theimmune system, if possible. The most effective treatment is transplantation of blood-formingstem cellsfrom thebone marrowof a healthy person (calledbone marrow transplant/stem cell transplantor BMT/SCT). This therapy cures the condition in approximately 70% or more of people with severe combinedimmunodeficiency(SCID), including those affected by ADA. If a BMT/SCT is not an option,enzymereplacement therapy (ERT) may be recommended. ERT is a treatment that replaces the enzyme that is missing or not working properly (adenosine deaminase) with a synthetic form of the enzyme.[2][5][6]For more information about the treatment and management of ADA, pleaseclick here."
Craniopharyngioma,"Essentially, two main management options are available for craniopharyngiomas: (1) attempt at gross total resection or (2) partial surgery followed by radiotherapy.No firm consensus of opinion exists concerning the appropriate management of craniopharyngiomas, and no guidelines have as yet been established.Treatment may include a combination of the following: surgery to remove the full or partialtumor(resection),radiation therapy, cyst drainage,chemotherapy, andbiologic therapy.[2]Systemic biologic therapies currently under investigation with promising results includeinterferon(IFN) alpha-2a for progressive or recurrent craniopharyngiomas.[4]An experienced multidisciplinary team of different specialists (neurosurgeon,radiation oncologist, neuro-oncologist,endocrinologist,ophthalmologist) is essential for the best treatment of both pediatric and adult patients with craniopharyngiomas.[6]"
Spinocerebellar ataxia 7,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for spinocerebellarataxia7 (SCA7). Management of affected individuals is generally supportive because there is currently no known treatment to delay or stop the progression of the disease. Exercise and/orphysical therapyhas not been shown to help with incoordination or muscle weakness, but individuals with SCA7 should try to maintain active. Canes and walkers can help prevent falls. Modification of the home with conveniences such as grab bars, raised toilet seats, and ramps to accommodate motorized chairs may be necessary. Speech therapy and communication devices such as writing pads and computer-based devices may benefit those withdysarthria(difficulty speaking). Weighted eating utensils and dressing hooks can help maintain a sense of independence. Whendysphagia(difficulty swallowing) becomes troublesome, video esophagrams (a study using videox-raysof the esophagus) can identify the consistency of food least likely to trigger aspiration.[2]"
Sialadenitis,"The treatment of sialadenitis depends on what type of microbe is causing the infection. If the infection is bacterial, anantibioticeffective against whicheverbacteriais present will be the treatment of choice. If the infection is due to avirus, such as herpes, treatment is usually symptomatic but may include antiviral medications.[1][2][3][4]In addition, since sialadenitis usually occurs after decreased flow of saliva (hyposecretion), patients are usually advised to drink plenty of fluids and eat or drink things that trigger saliva flow (such as lemon juice or hard candy). Warm compresses, and gland massage may also be helpful if the flow is obstructed in some way. Good oral hygiene are also important. Occasionally an abscess may form which needs to be drained especially if it proves resistant to antibiotics (or antiviral medication)[1][2][3][4]In rare cases of chronic or relapsing sialadenitis, surgery may be needed to remove part or all of the gland. This is more common when there is an underlying condition which is causing the hyposecretion.[1]"
Ameloblastoma,"The preferred treatment for ameloblastoma is surgical removal of the affectedtissue. In an effort to prevent recurrence, a wide margin of healthy tissue should be removed from the area surrounding thetumor. If the tumor does return, surgery can be performed again.[2]Ameloblastoma rarely becomes malignant. If malignant spread of the tumor occurs, radiation may be recommended. Malignancy is more common in cases that reoccur after surgery.[2]Singh et al. have developed aTreatment Algorithm for Ameloblastoma, which you may find of interest."
Adenoma of the adrenal gland,"The best treatment options for adenomas of the adrenal gland depend on many factors, including whether or not the adenoma is ""functional"" (releasinghormones). People with adrenal adenomas that are not releasing hormones usually do not require any immediate treatment; however, they may need to follow up with a healthcare provider regularly to determine if the adenoma has grown and to make sure that it does not start producing hormones.[7]Functional adrenal adenomas are typically treated with surgery. Removal of the affected adrenal gland usually resolves other medical conditions that may be present as a result of elevated adrenal hormones (i.e.primary aldosteronism,Cushing's syndrome). In some cases, functional adrenal adenomas can be treated with medications that block the function or lower the levels of the overproduced hormone.[4][6][5][7]"
Adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 deficiency,"Although there is no cure for AMP1 deficiency, there may be ways to manage symptoms. One possibility  is the use of a sugar called D-ribose.[2][3][4]This sugar is easily absorbed in digestive system and rapidly cleared by metabolic pathways. It may provide an additional source of energy for muscle' however, the helpful effects of D-ribose are short-term.[3][4]"
Adenylosuccinase deficiency,"At the current time, there are no effective therapies for the treatment of adenylosuccinase deficiency. Treatment is supportive based on the specific features.[1]"
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,"Management is usually best accomplished by a team of physicians and other healthcare professionals. The team may include anutritionist, a pediatric (or adult)nephrologistorendocrinologist, and a clinicalgeneticist.[4]The basis of management involves free access to drinking water and toilet facilities. The polyuria can be lowered with a low-salt (sodium), low-proteindiet; thiazide diuretics:hydrochlorothiazideandchlorothiazide; other diuretics (i.e., potassium-sparing diureticamiloride); and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such asindomethacin. In babies, early recognition is very important because treatment can avoid the physical andintellectual disabilitythat results from repeated episodes of dehydration and high levels of sodium (hypernatremia). Infants and very young children should be offered water every two hours during the day and night. In severe cases, continuous gastric feeding may be required. In adults, the decision to treat is based upon the individual patient's intolerance of the polyuria and polydipsia since, in almost all patients, the thirst mechanism is sufficient to maintain the  sodium in the high-normal range. The medication desmopressin may be tried in patients who have persistent symptomatic polyuria after having the above described regimen. Several new approaches to treatment of this disorder are being investigated: V2 receptor chaperones and V2 receptor bypass.[4][6]"
"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2C","There is no specific treatment for LGMD2C. Management of the condition is based on each person's symptoms and may include:[4]Weight control to avoid obesityPhysical therapyand stretching exercises to promote mobility and preventcontracturesUse of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobilityMonitoring and surgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity andscoliosisMonitoring of respiratory function and use of respiratory aids when indicatedMonitoring for evidence of diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)Social and emotional support and stimulation to maximize a sense of social involvement and productivity and to reduce the sense of social isolation common in these disorders"
Adie syndrome,"Doctors may prescribe reading glasses to compensate for impaired vision in the affected eye, andpilocarpine dropsto be applied 3 times daily to constrict the dilated pupil. This may help with depth perception and reduce glare. For many, these strategies improve vision.[1][2]Thoracic sympathectomy, which severs the involved sympathetic nerve, is the definitive treatment for excessive sweating.[1]"
