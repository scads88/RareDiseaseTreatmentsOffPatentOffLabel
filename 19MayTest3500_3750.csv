Goldenhar disease,"The treatment of Goldenhar disease is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Ideally, affected children should be managed by an experienced multidisciplinarycraniofacialteam. Treatment is age dependent and certain interventions may be recommended at different stages of growth and development.[3][6][8]The following are examples of medical issues that may need to be addressed in a person affected by Goldenhar disease:[3][6]Feeding issues - some people affected by Goldenharsyndromemay have feeding difficulties caused by the associated craniofacial abnormalities. Interventions may include special bottles,supplemental nasogastric feedings, andgastrostomy tube placement.Breathing problems - affected people with an underdeveloped lower jaw may have difficulty breathing or developsleep apnea. In these cases, referral to appropriate medical specialists is recommended so appropriate care can be provided.Hearing loss- a hearing evaluation is recommended in all children with Goldenhar disease by 6 months of age. In those with hearing impairment, hearing aids or other treatments may be recommended.Epibulbartumors(noncancerous growths in the eyes) - these tumors may need to be surgically removed if they are particularly large or interfere with vision.Craniofacial abnormalities (i.e.cleft lip and/or palate),congenital heart defects, kidney problems, and/or spine abnormalities - some of the characteristic symptoms associated with Goldenhar disease may require surgical repair.Speech - people affected by Goldenhar disease are at an increased risk for a variety of speech problems due to the many associated craniofacial abnormalities. A speech evaluation and/or speech therapy may, therefore, be recommended in some affected people."
Myhre syndrome,"Treatment of Myhresyndromedepends on each symptom present. Special attention should be paid to limiting trauma totissues. Specialists that are involved in assessing or treating people with Myhre syndrome includecardiologists,orthopedists, respiratory specialists (lung doctors),gastroenterologists, and other healthcare professionals.[1][2]Some abnormalities or complications may require surgery. Long-term follow up and regular clinical checkups are needed to recognize the onset of certain symptoms or complications.[2]Early intervention is important to ensure that children with Myhre syndrome reach their potential. Special services that may be helpful for children may include special remedial education, special social support,physical therapy, speech therapy, or other services.[2]"
Herpes zoster oticus,"Prompt treatment of herpes zoster oticus is important for symptom relief and long-term outlook.[3]Treatment typically includes anti-inflammatory drugs calledsteroids, which may reduce the inflammation of the nerves and help to ease the pain. Antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, are often prescribed, although whether antiviral medications are beneficial for treating this condition has not been confirmed. Strong pain medications may be prescribed if the pain continues. An eye patch may be recommended to prevent injury to thecornea(corneal abrasion) and damage to the eye if it does not close completely. Vertigo  and dizziness may be treated with other medications.[4]"
Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy,"Due to the rarity of the condition, the best approach for effective treatment is currently unclear. Several treatments have been mentioned in case reports including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),plasmapheresis(PE),corticosteroids,azathioprine,mycophenolate mofetil, andrituximab. Although some patients showed temporary improvements with IVIG and PE, the majority of cases did not respond to any of these treatments.[1]"
Factor 2 deficiency,"The treatment of factor II deficiency depends on the exact cause and severity of the disease. When a person with factor II deficiency has bleeding episodes,fresh frozen plasma, the part of the blood that contains the clotting factors,can be used to treat the bleeding. If a person with factor II deficiency requires surgery,plasma exchange therapymay be used to increase factor II (prothrombin) levels prior to surgery. People who have acquired factor II deficiency may benefit from takingvitamin K. Some people with factor II deficiency may be recommended to avoid activities that can result in physical contact or injuries.[2]In some cases,prothrombin complex concentratescan be used to increase factor II levels. However, because these concentrates contain clotting factors other than factor II, they can result in an increased risk for blood to clot too quickly within the blood vessels (thromboembolic event)[2]."
Factor V deficiency,"Resources state that fresh plasma or fresh frozen plasma infusions will correct the deficiency temporarily and may be administered daily during a bleeding episode or after surgery.[1][3]During severe bleeding episodes,plateletconcentrates may be needed.[3]Individuals with factor V deficiency should discuss treatment options with their primary health care provider and ahematologist."
Sjogren-Larsson syndrome,"Topical application of various agents have been used to treat the ichthyosis.[2]Someclinical studieshave found that a drug called zileuton can be beneficial in the treatment of SLS. In these studies, the drug successfully reduced the severity of the pruritis (itching), and improved the behavior of the treated child. While this drug does not cure SLS, it has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life of children with SLS.[1]Seizuresusually respond well to anti-convulsant medications andspasticityis improved with surgery. Diets supplemented with medium-chain fatty acids have been reported to improve the skin, but the results are inconsistent.[2]More detailed information about treatment options for SLS can be accessed through theTreatmentandMedicationsections of Medscape Reference."
Tyrosinemia type 1,"There is currently no cure for tyrosinemia type 1. Individuals with this condition need to be on a special diet restricted in twoamino acids, tyrosine and phenylalanine, throughout life. Affected individuals may also be treated with a medication callednitisinone. Treatment should start as soon as the condition is diagnosed.  Some individuals require a liver transplant if their liver disease is already advanced before treatment begins.[2][3]Detailed information on the treatment of tyrosinemia type 1 is available fromGeneReviews."
Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome,"Individuals withfamilialcold autoinflammatorysyndrome(FCAS) are generally advised to avoid exposure to cold temperatures. Bed rest, warmth andcorticosteroidscan be used to treat an acute attack.[4]Treatment may include the use ofbiologic agents(drugs derived from living material) which can control the symptoms of FCAS by blockinginterleukin-1; they are called selective recombinant interleukin-1 receptor agonists. Examples of these agents are rilonacept,anakinra, and canakinumab.[5][4]These agents reportedly have a significant beneficial effect on quality of life for individuals with FCAS.[4]"
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,"The best treatment options for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are determined by a number of factors, including the severity of symptoms, the  age of onset, and the underlying cause of the condition.In acquired HLH, it is often necessary to treat the underlying condition. For example, antiobiotics or antiviral medications can be used to treat or prevent infections that may have triggered the exaggerated immune response.Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantationis considered a cure forfamilialHLH. It is often recommended that people with confirmed or suspected familial HLH undergo this treatment as early in life as possible. Prior to hematopoieticcelltransplanation,  people with HLH are usually treated withchemotherapyand/orimmunotherapyto destroy excessimmune cellswhich can lead to life-threatening inflammation.[4][5][3][7]Please visit the Histiocyte Society to learn more aboutthe treatment guidelines for HLH."
Fatal familial insomnia,"There is currently no cure for fatalfamilialinsomnia (FFI) or treatment that can slow the disease progression. The management goal is to ease symptoms and keep the person with FFI as comfortable as possible.[1][11]However research is ongoing and a number of potential treatments are being developed.[2][4][7][8]As of 2016, a number of treatments have had some success in slowing disease progression inanimal models, includingpentosan polysulfate,quinacrine(mepacrine), andamphotericin B. Sadly, the results have been less clear inclinical trialsin humans.[8]In Italy, a clinical trial trying to prevent symptoms in people known to have the genetic changes for FFI but have not yet developed symptoms is underway usingdoxyclycline.[4]Most promisingly, several forms ofimmunotherapyhave reported success. The three main research areas focus onantibodyvaccines, dendriticcellvaccines, and adoptive transfer of physiological prionprotein-specific CD4+T-lymphocytes. More research is being done to study how well these treatments work (effectiveness) and if the treatments are safe, but medical researchers believe that these or similar immunotherapies may offer hope for those with FFI in the future.[7][8]"
Jones syndrome,"Due to the rarity of Jonessyndrome, there are no treatment guidelines available in the medical literature. However, there is information about how the features associated with Jones syndrome might be treated.Treatment for gingival fibromatosis varies depending on the severity. Maintaining good oral hygiene is very important. Surgery to remove the enlarged gumtissuein the mouth (gingivectomy) may be needed for functional and/or cosmetic reasons. Enlargement may recur to various extents, and repeated surgeries may be needed to reshape the gums. It has been recommended that whenever possible, this treatment should be performed after the complete eruption of permanent teeth.[2]The goal of treatment forsensorineural hearing lossis to improve hearing. People with sensorineuralhearing lossmay use hearing aids; telephone amplifiers and other assistive devices; sign language (for those with severe hearing loss); and/or speech reading (such as lip reading and using visual cues to aid communication). Acochlear implantmay be recommended for some people with severe hearing loss.[5]"
Familial hemiplegic migraine,"There is no cure for FHM and no standardized treatment recommendations. Various migraine medications (tricyclic antidepressants,beta blockers,calcium channel blockers) and antiseizuremedications (topiramate,lacosamide,levetiracetam,valproate) may be utilized for individuals with frequent attacks. In general, medications that constrict the blood vessels (vasoconstricting agents) should be avoided as they may increase the risk of stroke.[1]"
Familial hemiplegic migraine type 1,"Treatment of hemiplegic migraine varies depending on severity and which symptoms are most problematic for the patient. In general, treatments aim to manage symptoms. Drugs that are effective in the prevention of common migraines may be used in hemiplegic migraine.[2]Prophylacticmanagement is applied to patients with frequent, long lasting, or severe attacks. Examples of migraine drugs that have been tried with variable success in people with hemiplegic migraine, include oral verapamil, acetazolamide, lamotrigine.[2]There are a few articles describing the use of nasal administration of ketamine, intravenous verapamil, and triptans for treatment of aura in people with hemiplegic migraine. Use of triptans in hemiplegic migraine is controversial and may be contraindicated in people with severe attacks.[2]For further information on these and other treatments, we recommend that you speak with your healthcare provider."

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome,"While there is no proven treatment for TRAPS, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may be used to relieve symptoms of fever, andcorticosteroidsmay be used to reduce severity of symptoms in most people. However, these medications typically don't decrease the frequency of attacks.Etanercept, a TNF inhibitor, has been shown to be effective but its efficacy tends to wane over time. Standard doses of etanercept twice a week have been shown to decrease the frequency, duration, and severity of attacks in some people and it may also reverse or slow the progression of amyloidosis. More studies are needed to evaluate this medication for TRAPS.[4][5]Additional information about the treatment of TRAPS can be viewed on Medscape's Web site."
Familial hypercholesterolemia,"The overall goal of treatment forfamilialhypercholesterolemia (FH) is to lower the risk foratherosclerosis(build-up of plaque in the arteries) by lowering the LDL cholesterol levels in the blood stream. The first step in treatment for individuals with theheterozygousform (also called theautosomal dominantform) is changing the diet to reduce the total amount of fat eaten. This may be accomplished by limiting the amount of beef, pork, and lamb in the diet; cutting out butter, whole milk, fatty cheeses and oils; and eliminating egg yolks,organmeats and other sources of saturated fat from animals. Dietary counseling is often recommended to help individuals change their eating habits. Exercise and weight loss may also help in lowering cholesterol levels.Drug therapy is also often necessary lifestyle changes may not be enough to lower cholesterol levels. Several different cholesterol-lowering medications may be used alone or in combination; they may includestatins,bile acid sequestrants,ezetemibe,niacin,gemfibrozil, andfenofibrate.Individuals with the more severe,homozygousform of FH (also called theautosomal recessiveform) need more aggressive therapies to treat their significantly elevated levels of cholesterol. Drug therapy is often not effective enough at lowering LDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, individuals with this form may need periodical LDL apheresis, a procedure that removes LDL from the blood. In some cases, major surgery such as a liver transplant is necessary.[4]"
Gitelman syndrome,"The mainstay treatment of Gitelmansyndromeinvolves careful monitoring, high-sodium and potassium diet, and oral potassium and magnesium supplements. Intravenous magnesium and/or potassium may be needed if symptoms are severe. People who have low potassium levels despite supplementation and diet, may benefit from potassium-sparing diuretics, renin angiotensin system blockers, pain medications, and/ornonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).[4][3]TheBlanchard A et al., 2017consensus guideline offers detailed treatment information, including information on drug selection, dosing recommendations, and a listing of drugs that can cause adverse effects in people with Gitelman syndrome.Lastly, people with Gitelman syndrome should have a thorough heart work-up. People with Gitelman syndrome and a prolonged QT interval should avoid drugs that prolong the QT interval. TheSADS Foundation offers a tool for learning more about what drugs to avoid.[4]"
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"In the past, the goals of treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have been to prevent more lung scarring, relieve symptoms, maintain the ability to be active, and improve the quality of life.[2]More recently,pirfenidone(an anti-fibrotic drug) has been approved to treat people with mild-to-moderate IPF in the European Union, Canada, and Asia.[3]The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has grantedBreakthrough Therapy Designationfor pirfenidone andnintedanib, due to trials suggesting they slow the progression of IPF.[4]Several other drugs are being studied as potential treatments includingcotrimoxazole,thalidomide,sildenafil, andimatinib mesylate. However, more research is needed to determine their safety and effectiveness.[3]Most affected people needoxygen therapyat some point to increase oxygen levels in the bloodstream. Oxygen therapy can reduce breathlessness and allow people to be more active. Some people benefit frompulmonary rehabilitation, used for people with chronic lung diseases.People with IPF may eventually need alung transplant. This is more likely in younger patients (under 65) with severe disease who have not responded to other treatments, and who don't have other serious medical problems. Some consider lung transplants for people over 65 who don't have other serious medical problems.For many years,corticosteroids(such as prednisolone) along with immunosuppressive drugs (such as azathioprine) were used to treat IPF. Sometimes an additional drug called N-acetylcysteine has also been used. These drugs were recommended based on the theory that generalized inflammation was a major part of IPF. However, the drugs were often ineffective and there has not been evidence that they improve long-term survival.Gastroesophageal reflux may be treated with standard medications. Some studies have shown longer survival times and lower fibrosis scores in people receiving treatment for gastroesophageal reflux.[3]"
Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer,"Skin growths (cutaneous leiomyomas) associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renalcellcancer(HLRCC) should be examined by adermatologist. Treatment of these may include surgery to remove a painful growth;cryoablationand/or lasers; and/or medications such ascalcium channel blockers,alpha blockers,nitroglycerin,antidepressants, and/orantiepileptic drugs(AEDs), which have been reported to reduce pain.[4]Uterine fibroids should be evaluated by a gynecologist. These are typically treated in the same manner as those that occur in the general population. However, most women with HLRCC need medication and/or surgical removal of the fibroids (myomectomy) at a younger age. Medications may includegonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists(GnRHa), antihormonal drugs, and pain relievers.Hysterectomyshould be performed only when necessary.[4]Early detection of kidneytumorsin HLRCC is important because they grow aggressively. Totalnephrectomymay be strongly considered in individuals with a detectable renal mass.[4]"
Marcus Gunn phenomenon,"While it may not be needed in every case, people with Marcus Gunn phenomenon may benefit from surgery. Children with Marcus Gunn phenomenon need to be regularly monitored foramblyopia. If not addressed by age 7 to 10 years of age, amblyopia may become untreatable.[10]Untreated severeptosiscan also result in vision loss.[10]Other associated eye problems, such as horizontalstrabismus,  vertical strabismus, anddouble elevator palsytypically need to be addressed before considering how to manage Marcus Gunn phenomenon itself.[11]These related eye problems may be corrected with eyeglasses, surgery, and/or medications.[1]Surgery for Marcus Gunn phenomenon may be considered forptosisor jaw winking that is considered cosmetically significant, or causing amblyopia. Depending on the degree of ptosis and severity of jaw winking, several surgical techniques have been proposed.[11]For mild Marcus Gunn phenomenon, management has included observation,levator muscleresection, and theFasanella-Servat procedure.[11]More detailed information about treatment of Marcus Gunn phenomenon is available on Medscape Reference's Web site and can be viewedhere."
Mondini dysplasia,"Surgery to repair the defect present with Mondini dysplasia is typically necessary to prevent recurrentmeningitis.[3][5]Prophylacticantimicrobial therapy (such asantibiotics) to prevent infection andconjugate pneumococcal vaccinationare helpful in reducing the formation ofbacteriain affected individuals.[3]If an individual has residual hearing, hearing amplification aids may be useful.[6]The use ofcochlear implantsto treat patients with inner ear malformations such as Mondini dysplasia has been increasingly successful. Various results of cochlear implantation in individuals with Mondini dysplasia have been reported in the literature.[6]"
Familial osteochondritis dissecans,"The primary aim of treatment for osteochondritis dissecans is to restore normal function of the affected joint, relieve pain and prevent osteoarthritis. Treatment for the condition varies depending on many factors including the age of the affected person and the severity of the symptoms. In children and young teens, osteochondritis dissecans often heals overtime without surgical treatment. These cases are often managed with rest and in some cases, crutches and/or splinting to relieve pain and swelling.[1][2][4]If non-surgical treatments are not successful or the case is particularly severe (i.e. the cartilage and bone are moving around within the joint space), surgery may be recommended. Following surgery,physical therapyis often necessary to improve the strength and range of motion of the affected joint.[1][2][4]"
Pigmented purpuric dermatosis,"If the condition is mild, treatment may not be necessary. For those who suffer from itching,topical steroidsand antihistamines may be useful. Compression stockings may be used if the lower legs are affected.[1][2]Additional treatments that have been successful in limited studies includepentoxifylline,[3]aminaphtone,[4]photochemotherapy (PUVA)[5],griseofulvin, oralcyclosporin, andascorbic acidwith rutoside.[6]"
Precocious puberty,"Several studies have looked at the long-term effects of treatment withhormone therapyon children with precocious puberty. Long-term hormone treatment has been found to be safe for the reproductive system and helpful in reaching target adult height levels.[2]Additionally, there is little evidence suggesting that long term hormone treatment is associated with psychological or behavioral problems. More studies are needed to determine this association.[3]"
Primary biliary cholangitis,"Ursodiol is the drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of primary biliary  cholangitis.[2]For more information on treatment of primary biliary cholangitis with Ursodiol, please visit the following link from PBCers Organization, a nonprofit organization that supports primary biliary  cholangitis.http://www.pbcers.org/about-pbc/ursodiol.php"
Progressive supranuclear palsy,"There are currently no treatments that alter the course of disease for people with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and no drugs that provide significant relief of symptoms.[5]However, supportive treatment may be helpful and may include:Management ofdysphagiaanddysarthriawith the help ofdietitiansas well as speech and language therapistsEarly occupational therapy to promote longer independence in performing activities of daily livingThe use of mirror-prism lenses for those with severe limitation of extraocular movements to read and feed themselvesThe use of eyelid crutches, alone or in combination with botox therapy, for inability to open the eyes andblepharospasmPhysical therapyfor symptomatic treatment of postural instability and falls, including gait and balance training[5]A surgical procedure called agastrostomymay be necessary when there are swallowing disturbances or a high risk of severe choking.[1]"
Pulmonary arterial hypertension,"People with pulmonary arterialhypertension(PAH) benefit from receiving treatment at specialized centers.[3]ThePulmonary Hypertension Associationoffers aFind a Doctortool which may aid you in locating your nearest center.Treatment of serious or life threatening PAH may involve continuousIV epoprostenol. Other treatment options, includetreprostinil,iloprost,bosentan,ambrisentan,sildenafil, andtadalafil. Many of these treatments can be administered in various forms, such as by shot, IV, or inhalation. A small number of people with PAH respond well to long term oralcalcium channel blockers. Blood thinners,diuretics, and supplemental oxygen may be prescribed as needed.[3]Many drugs can be harmful to people with PAH. The following should be avoided: appetite suppressants, cocaine, amphetamines (and related compounds), low oxygen environments (such as high altitudes), and possiblyestrogencompounds (oral contraceptives andhormonereplacement therapy).[3]"
Schizencephaly,"The best treatment options for people with schizencephaly depend on many factors, including the severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms present. For example, people withdevelopmental delay(i.e. delayed motor milestones) or partial paralysis may be referred forphysical therapyand/oroccupational therapy. Medications are often prescribed to preventseizures. In cases that are complicated byhydrocephalus, a surgically implanted tube, called a shunt, is often used to divert fluid to another area of the body where it can be absorbed.[1][2]"
Hereditary spastic paraplegia,"There are no specific treatments to prevent, slow, or reverse HSP. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Medications may be considered forspasticityand urinary urgency. Regularphysical therapyis important for muscle strength and to preserve range of motion.[1][4][2]"
Testotoxicosis,"Decisions regarding treatment for patients with testotoxicosis are complex.[3]Treatment typically consists of reducing hyperandrogenism in children (sexual maturation, stature) withketoconazoleor a combination of antiandrogens and aromatase inhibitors.[3][4]Recently, the use of combination therapy withbicalutamide(a potent antiandrogen agent) andanastrozoleorletrozole(third-generation aromatase inhibitors) was reported to yield encouraging short-term results, including slower growth rate.[5][6]"
Familial thyroglossal duct cyst,"Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated thyroglossal duct cysts. The Sistrunk procedure is typically performed, which can reduce the risk of recurrence. This involves removing the cyst as well as a portion of the hyoid bone (small bone in the upper neck) and some tonguetissue. Researchers are looking into the efficacy of ethanol sclerotherapy, in which ethanol, a type of alcohol, is injected into the cyst. While results are promising, surgery remains the primary treatment method.[1][2]"
Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL). It is typically  managed through dietary restrictions, including a low-fat diet and supplementation of a specific type of fat more easily absorbed by individuals with this condition (medium chain triglycerides). These restrictions usually continue throughout life. Periodic intravenous (IV) infusion of aproteincalled albumin may be useful in treating swelling of the lower limbs and/or buildup of excess bodily fluids. Use of certainhormones, such asoctreotide, may be useful in treating individuals not responding to dietary changes. Surgery is usually not needed unless the disease is limited to one area of the intestine.[2][3]"

Fanconi Bickel syndrome,"Management of Fanconi Bickelsyndrome(FBS) generally focuses on treating the signs and symptoms of the condition. For treatment of the symptoms ofkidney disease, a doctor may focus on replacing the water andelectrolytesthat are lost from the kidneys. Additionally,vitamin Dand phosphate supplements can help prevent bone weakening (rickets).[6]It is recommended that people with Fanconi Bickel syndrome follow a galactose-restricted diet. Galactose is a substance that is broken down into glucose. Because people with Fanconi Bickel syndrome have trouble moving glucose throughout the body, limiting galactose prevents the buildup of glucose and glycogen in the liver and kidneys. Galactose is found in food such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and legumes. People with Fanconi Bickel syndrome should primarily eat fructose as their main carbohydrate. In addition, people with Fanconi Bickel syndrome should eat small, frequent meals in order to avoid developinglow blood sugarbetween meals. Finally, cornstarch may be used as a substitute to provide necessary sugars to the body.[6]"
Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome,Treatment may includeantibioticsand glucocorticoids.  Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[2]
Febrile Ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease,"It is important that FUMHD is diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.[1]While a number of treatments have been tried, it is hard to asses the benefit of the therapies because there are so few cases of FUMHD and among reported cases the treatment approach may vary. The case reports describe treatment with systemic steroids, methotrexate,antibiotics, dapsone, cyclosporine, psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), unspecified ultraviolet receptor, acyclovir, immunoglobulins, and 4,4-diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS). Again the efficacy of these therapies are not known.[1][2][3][6][7][8][9]Acyclovir was prescribed in cases where varicella was initially suspected. None of these cases turned out to be associated with herpes simplex or varicella-zostervirusinfection. The benefit of acyclovir therapy in people with FUMHD is questionable.[2]Systemic steroids have been commonly utilized among reported cases (27 of 40 cases), with only one report of a positive effect.[7]Methotrexate has been used in 15 patients. It induced rapid remissions and was successful in cases that did not respond to other therapies. Still four patients died despite methotrexate theapy. It is possible this was due to its late institution.[7]Debridement and skin grafting was successful in one case, but the patient was left with considerable scaring.[1]In advanced disease, therapy is also aimed at stabilizing the patient. Intensive care treatment of infection and maintenance of the patient’s general condition is vital.[1][7]The state of these patients is similar to what is seen in patients with severe burns. Thus, patients with FUMHD may benefit from the same supportive services that burn victims receive.[9]Treatment withtumornecrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors (such as infliximab and etanercept) has been suggested as a first-line option in the management of FUMHD because elevated levels of serum TNF-alpha have been reported in this disease[7][10]However, further studies may be required to establish this approach to treatment.More detailed information about treatment options for FUMHD can be accessed through theDermNet NZweb site."
Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome,"Treatment for persistent Mullerian ductsyndrome(PMDS) may involve surgery to place thetesteswithin the scrotum and to remove Müllerian structures. Treatment aims to prevent the two main complications:cancerand infertility.[3]Surgery to place the testes within the scrotum (orchidopexy) is recommended due to the risk of cancer otherwise. Whether to remove Müllerian structures has been controversial in the past.[3][4]Authors of more recent articles have recommended removing Müllerian structures  due to increasing reports of cancer, and because they can also cause discomfort and hematuria (blood in the urine).[3]It has been suggested that surgery should be done between the ages of one and two years to reduce the risk of damaging the vas deferens. Orchidopexy and removal of Mullerian structures should be done at the same time or as a staged procedure  if needed.[4]Some causes of infertility (whether present at birth or due to surgical treatment) may be treatable by extracting sperm from the testicles and usingassisted reproductive technology(ART).[3]"
Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia,"As there is no universalscreeningtest for NAIT, the first case of NAIT in a family is often unexpected.[2][4]However, there is a high recurrence risk for NAIT and consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist or other professional with experience treating NAIT is indicated in future pregnancies once a diagnosis of NAIT is made.[2][3]Blood tests performed on the mother, father, and baby can be used to decide which pregnancies/babies are at risk.[4]Management for pregnancies determined to be at risk remains controversial but may include a planned delivery and maternal avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and aspirin during pregnancy. Management strategies have also included maternal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or maternalsteroidsand more invasive procedures such asfetal blood samplingand fetalplatelet transfusions. The less invasive approach is currently favored.[3][4][5]Management of the affected infant after birth depends on the specific signs and symptoms but may include periodic ultrasounds of the brain to check for bleeding,platelettransfusion, and IVIG. In the absence of intracranial bleeding, theprognosisis generally favorable and the platelet count usually improves within 8 to 10 days.[3]"
Fetal valproate syndrome,"The treatment of fetal valproatesyndrome(FVS) is based on the signs and symptoms present in each baby or child. Management often involves a team of medical specialists and may include:[1][2]Birth defectssuch as spina bifida and other neural tube defects,congenital heart defects, andcleft lipand/orcleft palatemay require surgery shortly after birthLong-term follow-up to detect and treat early behavioral or developmental issuesEarly speech therapy, occupational therapy, and/orphysical therapyExtra assistance at school"
Frontal fibrosing alopecia,"Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA).[2]Because the hair loss associated with this condition is thought to be caused by inflammation of hair follicles, treatment often involves using anti-inflammatory medications or ointments, such ascorticosteroids,tetracyclines, orhydroxychloroquine(brand name Plaquenil), to reduce inflammation and suppress the body'simmune system.[7]Medications that block the production of the malehormone5-alpha reductase (finasteride) have been reported to stop further hair loss in some women.[2][4]Intralesional injection of medication and systemic therapies (taken by mouth) seem to be more effective than those applied to the skin. In many cases, a combination of treatments works best.[4]Some researchers continue to question whether treatment is effective or if hair loss in FFA just stops naturally.[8]"
FG syndrome,"Treatment is aimed at addressing the individual symptoms present in each case.[3][2][5]This often involves care by a team of providers which may includepediatricians,neurologists,cardiologists, surgeons,gastroenterologists, and psychologists.[5]Early intervention and special education services should be initiated as soon as possible so that each child can reach his fullest potential.[3][2][5]GeneReviewsprovides a detailed list of management strategies."
Floating-Harbor syndrome,"The treatment of FHS is directed toward specific symptoms. Early intervention and services are important to insure that children with FHS reach their potential. Treatment may require the coordinated effort of a team of specialists, including:pediatricians,neurologists,orthopedists,audiologists,ophthalmologists,occupational therapists,physical therapists, andspeech therapists.[3][4]Additional social and vocational services may also help. In some cases, behavior management strategies may be needed.[3][4]Yearly testing of vision, hearing, blood pressure, and kidney function are suggested.Ultrasoundimagingto check for kidney (renal) cysts in affected teenagers and adults  is also suggested.[4]Growthhormonehas been used to treat some individuals with FHS, although information about its effectiveness in this population is limited.[3][4]"
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva,"There is currently no definitive treatment.  However, a brief course of high-dosecorticosteroids, such asPrednisone, started within the first 24 hours of a flare-up, may help reduce the intense inflammation andtissueswelling seen in the early stages of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.  Other medications, such as muscle relaxants, mastcellinhibitors, and aminobisphosphonates, if appropriate, should be closely monitored by a physician.  Surgery to remove heterotopic and extra-skeletal bone is risky and can potentially cause painful new bone growth.[3]"
Fibrosing mediastinitis,"There is no cure for fibrosing mediastinitis and the benefits of current treatments are unclear. In general, treatment options depend on which structures of the mediastinum are affected (i.e. the heart, large blood vessels, windpipe, esophagus, andlymph nodes), the severity of the scarring and, in some cases, the cause of the condition. For example, fibrosing mediastinitis caused byhistoplasmosismay be treated with antifungal medications while cases caused byautoimmune disordersmay respond best tocorticosteroids.[4]Other treatment options include surgery to removed scarredtissueand local therapies to treat specific problems (i.e.stents,laser therapy).[2][3]"
Fibrous dysplasia,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for fibrous dysplasia.[1][2]Treatment depends on the symptoms present.Fractures often require surgery, but can sometimes be treated with casting or splints.[1][3]] Surgery is most appropriate in cases where fractures are likely to occur, or where bones have become misshapen. Surgery may also be used to relieve pain.Medications known as bisphosphonates are also used to relieve bone pain.[1][3][4]Other healthy strategies such as physical activity and adequate intake of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D are also encouraged.[[1]Radiation therapyis not recommended for patients with fibrous dysplasia because it is associated with an increased risk of canceroustransformation.[1][3][4]Careful, long-term follow-up to monitor fibrous dysplasia is advised."
Filippi syndrome,"The treatment of Filippisyndromeis directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of medical professionals who may need to systematically and comprehensively plan an affected child's treatment. These professionals may includepediatricians; physicians who specialize in disorders of the skeleton, joints, muscles, and relatedtissues(orthopedists); and/or other health care professionals. In some affected individuals, treatment may include surgical repair of certain skeletal or other abnormalities associated with the disorder. The surgical procedures performed will depend upon the severity of the abnormalities, their associated symptoms, and other factors.[3]"
