Spinocerebellar ataxia,"There is no known cure for spinocerebellarataxia(SCA). The best treatment options for SCA vary by type and often depend on the signs and symptoms present in each person. The most common symptom of SCA is ataxia (a condition in which coordination and balance are affected).Physical therapycan help strengthen muscles, while special devices (e.g., cane, crutches, walker, or wheelchair) can assist in mobility and other activities of daily life.[1]Many people with SCA have other symptoms in addition to the ataxia such as tremors, stiffness, muscle spasms, and sleep disorders; medications or other therapies may be suggested for some of these symptoms.[3]One report described some improvement in the symptoms withzolpidem10 mg in four out of five family members with SCA type 2, and a trial of 20 patients with SCA3 found thatvareniclineled to improvement in some, but not all of the symptoms.[6]"
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6,"While there is no specific treatment which can prevent of slow the progression of SCA6, there are therapies available to help manage the symptoms.[2]For instance:[3]Episodes ofataxia, vertigo, and sleep disorders can be treated with medication,Home modifications may be made for safety and convenience,Canes and walkers can allow for continued mobility,Speech therapy and communication devices may help withdysarthria, andWeighted eating utensils and dressing hooks can help patients maintain independence.Affected individuals should be followed annually or semiannually by aneurologist, with consultations as needed with other specialists.[3]More detailed information related to the treatment of SCA6 can be accessed through theGeneReviewsWeb site."
X-linked dominant scapuloperoneal myopathy,There is no standard course of treatment for scapuloperoneal myopathy. Some patients may benefit fromphysical therapyor other therapeutic exercises.[1]
Scleroderma,"There is no cure for scleroderma, but treatments are available to relieve symptoms and limit damage toorgans. Treatment varies depending on each person's symptoms.[2]Medications that may be used to treat scleroderma include:[1]CorticosteroidsImmune suppressing medications (methotrexate,Cytoxan)Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs)Other treatments for specific symptoms may include:[1][6][7]Drugs for heartburn or swallowing problems (proton pump inhibitors)Prokinetic agents to speeding the movement of food through the stomach and intestinesAntibioticsto addressmalabsorption syndromeBlood pressure medications (particularlyACE inhibitors) forhigh blood pressureor kidney problemsAntihistamines and skin moisturizers to relieve itchingMedicines to prevent (e.g., Bosentan) or treat (e.g., iloprost) ulcersMedicines to improve breathing (See:Pulmonary hypertension)Medicines to treat lung scarring (e.g., cyclophosphamide)Medications to treatRaynaud's phenomenon(e.g., nifedipine, iloprost)More detailed information regarding the treatment of scleroderma can be accessed throughMedscape Reference."
Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda X-linked,"Many affected individuals require joint replacement surgery (hip, knee, shoulder) or spine surgery (correction ofscoliosisorkyphosis).Hip replacementis often required as early as 30 years of age. Chronic pain management is standard and often required before or after surgery. Affected individuals should be regularly followed by a professional familiar with this condition for the development of joint pain and scoliosis.[3]"
Selective IgM deficiency,"Treatment for selective IgM deficiency (SIgMD) varies because some people do not have symptoms, while others are at risk for serious infections. In general, fevers and infections should be evaluated and treated as soon as possible, especially if they seem to be getting worse.[1]People with no symptoms may not need specific treatment.Measures should be taken to prevent infections whenever possible. Measures that have been recommended include:[1]Having all recommended vaccinations.Aggressive treatment of allergies such as asthma and allergic rhinitis (nasal allergies).Prophylacticantibioticsfor people who continue to get sick often.Immune globulin therapy(IVIG) - several researchers have reported a reduction in frequency and severity of infections in people with SIgMD treated with IVIG.[2]People with SIgMD who experience new or different symptoms should be evaluated for an associated underlying disease or condition.[1]Symptoms of SIgMD may improve or go away if an associated disorder is treated or improves.[1]"
Sepiapterin reductase deficiency,"Treatment of sepiapterin reductase deficiency may involve levodopa (L-dopa), carbidopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan.[2][3]General information on levodopa and carbidopa can be found on the MedlinePlus Web site byclicking here.Treatment should be started as soon as possible in order to avoid irreversible neurological damage and continued for life.[2]The amounts of L-dopa administered to people with sepiapterin reductase deficiency vary, but, in general, tends to be between 0.1 and 16 mg/kg/day. 5-hydroxytryptophan doses tend to be between 0.14 to 6 mg/kg/day.[2][3]Combination therapy is introduced slowly and increased by  over the course of days or weeks until the final target concentration is reached. People receiving this treatment regimen require careful monitoring because increasing the dose too quickly can cause side-effects. Patients receiving treatment may be monitored with routine evaluations by a pediatricneurologist, video documentation, and follow-up testing looking at cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) metabolite concentrations. Samples of CSF are obtained bylumbar puncture.[4]If L-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan in combination with carbidopa are not well tolerated or don't achieve the desired results, other medications may be considered. These include monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, melatonin, dopamine agonists, anticholinergics, and methylphenidate. While these medications address the motor abnormalities of the condition, cognitive delays commonly remain.[3]"
Sezary syndrome,"In general, there are six different treatment options available to people with Sezarysyndrome. These include:[2]Photodynamic therapyRadiation therapyChemotherapyOther drug therapy (i.e. topical steriods, retinoids)Biologic therapyTargeted therapyTo learn more about the treatment and management of Sezary syndrome, including specific information about each of the treatments listed above, please visit theNational Cancer Institute'sWeb site.

Situs inversus,"In isolated situs inversus, no treatment may be necessary. When situs inversus is associated with another condition, treatment may depend on the associated condition and the signs and symptoms present in the affected person.[1]Knowing that a person has situs inversus is important for diagnosing medical problems and preventing surgical mishaps that can result from the failure to recognize reversed anatomy. For example, in a person with situs inversus, appendicitis causes pain in the left lower abdomen instead of the right lower abdomen.[3]Wearing medical identification can help ensure proper treatment in an emergency medical situation."
Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis,"Many different methods have been used to try to manage SLK with varying levels of success. The most common treatment is large diameter contact lens wear.[3][7]Other options include:[2][4]Silver nitrate(antiseptic) solutionMastcellstabilizers (used to prevent or control allergic reactions)Vitamin ApreparationsCyclosporine AAutologous (self) serum–derived dropsBotulinuminjection to the overlying muscleSurgical options include cryotherapy (use of cold to destroy abnormaltissue), conjunctival resection of the superior limbal conjunctiva, and thermal cautery of superior limbal conjunctiva, which may be curative.[3][7][4]More detailed information related to the treatment of SLK can be accessed throughMedscape Reference."
Spinal muscular atrophy,"Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for spinal muscular atrophy. Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.[1]TheSpinal Muscular Atrophy Foundationoffers many patient resources regarding the treatment and management of people with spinal muscular atrophy. To access these resources, please click on the link.CureSMAhas a Web page entitled ""Living with SMA"" which includes management options for some of the key medical issues associated with spinal muscular atrophy and strategies for daily care."
Systemic mastocytosis,"Treatment for systemic mastocytosis (SM) is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, the following medications may used to treat various symptoms associated with SM:[2][6]Antihistamines to treat or prevent skin and gastrointestinal symptomsProton pump inhibitors to treat increased stomach acidEpinephrine to treatanaphylaxisSteroids to treatmalabsorption(impaired ability to take in nutrients)Mast-cellstabilizers such asketotifento treat some of the skin symptomsCromolyn sodiumto treat gastrointestinal symptoms, bone pain, headaches, and some of the skin manifestationsIf systemic mastocytosis is cancerous (mast cell leukemia) or associated with ablood disorder,steroidsand/orchemotherapymay be necessary.[7]More specific information about treatment options can be accessed through theTreatmentandMedicationsections of the Medscape Reference website."
Sydenham's chorea,"In most cases, patients with Sydenham's chorea recover fully with no treatment. Drugs that have been used to treat patients with significant movement problems includecorticosteroids,valproic acid,diazepam,chlorpromazine, andcarbamazepine. In patients who do not respond to these drugs,haloperidolorpimozidemay be used. In addition, patients with Sydenham's chorea are usually treated withantibioticsto prevent anotherStreptococcal infectionand to minimize the risk ofrheumatic heart disease. Sydenham's chorea usually resolves within 12-15 months, though symptoms may persist for two years or more. Up to 30% of patients experience a recurrence of Sydenham's chorea within a few years. Some believe that treatment with an antibiotic reduces the risk of recurrence.[2]"
Stickler syndrome,"After a person is diagnosed with Sticklersyndrome, some evaluations may be recommended to determine if there are other signs of the syndrome that have not been previously noticed. These evaluations may include an eye exam, exam by a doctor who can check for facial differences such ascleft palate(craniofacial specialist), a hearing (audiometry) exam, and an evaluation for any possible heart problems.[1]Treatment for Stickler syndrome is aimed at treating the specific symptoms each person has. For some, this may involve surgeries to correct cleft palate orretinal detachment. Other treatments may includehearing aidsforhearing lossor medications for joint pain.[1]"
Stiff skin syndrome,"At this time, no specific therapies are available to reverse the symptoms of stiff skinsyndrome(SSS). The recommended therapies aim to address issues moving the joints that may develop as a symptom of SSS. Regularphysical therapyand exercise may be recommended to improve or maintain joint movement. A number of treatments have been tried in individual cases, includingsteroids,immunosuppressant drugs, psoralens (light-sensitizing medications), and light therapy. These treatments have not been helpful in slowing or stopping symptoms of SSS.[2]Some study findings onanimal modelshave indicated potential future therapeutic options. In one study, mice with stiff skin syndrome were treated by blocking certainantibodies(integrin binding and TGF-beta antibodies). This prevented new skin lesions and reversed existing ones.[8]You can read more about this discovery through the following link to the Scleroderma Research Society:http://www.srfcure.org/research/funded-research/3301-interrogationAnother recent paper discussed the possibility of using a medication that suppresses theimmune systemcalledmycophenolate mofetilin combination with physical therapy to treat individuals with stiff skin syndrome. Although this treatment has only been used for a couple of affected individuals, the doctors noted an improvement in symptoms. However, these individuals had the segmental form of stiff skin syndrome. It is not known whether this treatment would work for every person with the segmental form of stiff skin syndrome, and it is not known if it will work at all for people with the classic form of stiff skin syndrome.[9]"
Swyer-James syndrome,"Individuals with Swyer-Jamessyndromereportedly have been treated conservatively in the past. However, although there are few reports published, it has been recognized thatsurgical treatmentshould be considered when infections cannot be controlled. There have been reports of affected individuals being treated with pneumonectomy (removal of a lung), lobectomy (removal of one or more lobes of a lung) or segmentectomy (removal of a specific segment).It has been proposed that individuals with Swyer-James syndrome may benefit from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), a procedure in which damagedtissueis removed from the lung. LVRS was reportedly performed successfully in an individual with Swyer-James syndrome, and it has been suggested that the procedure could be used for managing the condition in other affected individuals because it has shown to be effective for improving pulmonary function and symptoms.[3]"
