Chilaiditi syndrome,"Treatment of Chilaiditisyndromeis directed at the individual symptoms present. In some cases, treatment is not needed. Reducing (or removing) the pressure within the abdomen may help alleviate symptoms.[1]This may be achieved through conservative measure that address constipation, pain and distention.[2]Surgical intervention may include removal of a portion of the color or the anchoring of the liver to the abdominal wall.[1]"
Perniosis,"The main method of treatment for perniosis focuses on avoiding exposure to cold. Individuals with this condition may be advised to keep the affected areas of their body warm by wearing insulated clothing, gloves, and footwear. The use of ultraviolet light at the beginning of cold, damp season may help prevent outbreaks. It is also suggested that people with this condition do not use cigarettes or nicotine. The use of certain medications, such as topicalsteroidsandnifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, have been effective in treating some individuals.[2][3]"
Children's interstitial lung disease,"There is no single treatment for interstitial lung diseases in children.  Different forms of chILD require different treatments and support depending on the condition. The goals of treatment for chILD is to relieve symptoms, provide support to maximize growth and development, and to prevent exposure to preventable illnesses that could make the chILD worse.  See theChildren's Interstitial and Diffuse Lung Disease Foundationfor more detailed information about treatment."
Childhood hepatocellular carcinoma,"The treatment for childhood hepatocellular carcinoma (childhood HCC) is dependent on a number of factors including thePRETEXT and POSTTEXT group. This is a way of describing thetumorbefore treatment (PRETEXT) and after treatment (POSTTEXT). The course of treatment is additionally dependent on whether or not a tumor can be initially removed with surgery and whether thecancerhas spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body.[2][5]Treatment options for a tumor that can be removed by surgery at the time of diagnosis may include:[2][5]Surgery alone to remove the tumorSurgery andchemotherapyCombination chemotherapyfollowed by surgery to remove the tumorTreatment options for a tumor that cannot be removed by surgery at the time of diagnosis may include:[2][5][1]Chemotherapy to shrink the tumor followed by surgeryChemotherapy to shrink the tumor and if surgery to remove the tumor is not possible: liver transplant orchemoembolizationof thehepatic arteryto shrink the tumorRadioembolizationof the hepatic artery to relieve symptoms and improvequality of lifeTreatment for a childhood HCC that has spread to other parts of the body may include a combination of chemotherapy and surgery to remove as much of the tumor from the liver as possible as well as other places where the cancer has spread. If the childhood HCC is related to ahepatitis Bviral infection, treatment may additionally includeantiviral medications.[5]"
Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2,Pseudohypoaldosteronism may be treated withthiazide diuretics[4][5]and dietary restriction of sodium.[3]
Congenital chloride diarrhea,"Congenitalchloride diarrhea (CCD) is a lifelong disease, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Early diagnosis and treatment in the absence of major complications can lead to normal growth and development.[6]The main treatment is called saltsubstitutiontherapy (receiving sodium chloride and potassium chloride). Newborns are first given this therapy intravenously (by IV) and are later transitioned to oral therapy.[7]Diarrhea will persist through therapy even when there is adequate salt substitution, although the relative amount ofstoolgenerally decreases with age.[7][3]Treatment for episodes of acute gastroenteritis (""stomach flu"") in children with CCD is extremely important because they can experience rapid dehydration and loss of potassium (hypokalemia). These episodes should be treated with IV replacement of fluids and electrolytes. In adulthood, people with CCD are usually able to avoid dehydration by taking extra salt substitution.[3]"
Gilbert syndrome,"Gilbertsyndromegenerally doesn't require treatment. The bilirubin levels in the blood may fluctuate over time, causing episodes ofjaundice. However, the jaundice is usually mild and goes away on its own. In some cases, doctors may prescribephenobarbitalto lower extremely elevated bilirubin levels and reduce signs of jaundice. Phenobarbital administration usually alleviates signs of jaundice fairly quickly.[1][2]"
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,"Treatment for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy aims to relieve itching and prevent complications.
Medications utilized to relieve itching might includeursodiol(Actigall, Urso), which helps decrease the level of bile in the mother's bloodstream,
relieves itchiness and may reduce complications for the baby. To prevent
pregnancy complications, close monitoring of the baby might be
recommended. Even if prenatal tests appear normal, induction of early labor
might be recommended.[3]"
Cholesteatoma,"Initial treatment may involve careful cleaning of the ear,antibiotics, and eardrops. Therapy aims to stop drainage in the ear by controlling the infection.[4]Large or more complicated cholesteatomas may require surgery.[1][4]Cholesteatomas very often continue to grow if they are not removed. Surgery is usually successful.[4]"
Tietze syndrome,"In some individuals, the pain associated with Tietzesyndromeresolves on its own without any treatment. Management options for others may include avoidance of strenuous activity, applying heat or ice as directed by your doctor, taking pain medications, and/ornonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Some people benefit fromcorticosteroidor lidocaine injections if the pain does not respond to any other treatment.[1][2]"
Chordoma,"Chordomas are treated with surgery because thesetumorscontinuously grow, although they grow slowly. If the chordoma is not removed, it may wear away the bone and adjacent softtissue, causing destruction of surrounding tissues.[4]The surgery aims to remove as much of the tumor as possible. The extent of the surgery, or the amount of tumor that may be removed, depends on the location of the tumor and how close it is to critical structures in the brain. In some cases, surgery is followed byradiation therapyto destroy anycancercellsthat may remain after surgery, especially when the tumor cannot be removed completely.[5]Several studies have shown thatcarbon ion therapyorproton beam radiationmay control tumor growth and improve survival.[6]Radical resections of tumors (removal of all the tumor) with clean margins (with no remaining of the tumor) are associated with a longer period of being disease-free. If the tumor cannot be removed completely, because of the location and closeness to critical delicate structures, the addition of radiation therapy decreases the recurrence of the tumor.Frequent follow-up is needed because of the high rate of recurrence of these tumors. Tumor recurrence identified early is easier to treat. The time in between follow-up visits, including repeatMRIorCT scans, depends on the completeness of the resection. Because residual tumor  shortens the recurrence time, patients with known or suspected residual tumor need to be evaluated more frequently.[4]"
Retinochoroidal coloboma,"There is no cure for retinochoroidal coloboma. Treatment varies depending on the conditions or complications that present in each individual. In some instances, retinochoroidal colobomas do not cause any symptoms and treatment is not necessary. Complications that commonly occur include:[4][3]Tear or detachment of theretina(retinal detachment)Growth of new blood vessels  beneath the retina that disrupt vision (choroidal neovascularization)Clouding of the lens (cataracts)Increased eye pressure leading to damage to the optic nerve (glaucoma)Treatment of retinal detachment depends on the severity of the condition. For smaller retina tears, laser surgery (photocoagulation) or freezing treatment (cryopexy) may be utilized to induce a scar that helps to secure the retina to the eye wall. For larger tears or a detachment, surgery is typically needed to place the retina back into its proper position. Options may include: scleral buckle, pneumatic retinopexy, or vitrectomy.[3][5]Surgical treatment of retinal detachment in individuals with retinochoroidal coloboma can be challenging and has variable success.[4][3]Treatment for choroidal neovascularization may include administration of medications that can block the abnormal growth of blood vessels (anti-VEGF treatment), thermal laser treatment to destroy abnormal blood vessels, andphotodynamic therapyto damage unwanted blood vessels.[6]Cataracts are usually treated surgically via a technique called phacoemulsification. In this procedure, an instrument is used to break up and remove the cloudy lens. A lens implant is then placed to allow light to pass through and focus properly on the retina.[7]Glaucoma treatment varies and may include medication or surgery. Various surgical techniques can be utilized including: laser trabeculoplasty, laser iridotomy, peripheral iridectomy, trabeculectomy, and aqueous shunt surgery. The goal of surgery in glaucoma is to reduce the pressure on the eye.[8]The American Academy of Ophthalmology provides information and videos on treatment forretinal detachment,choroidal neovascularization,cataracts, andglaucoma."
Retinitis pigmentosa,"Available treatments aim to slow the progression of the disease and primarily include light avoidance and the use of low-vision aids. Some practitioners also consider vitamin A as a possible treatment option. However, taking too much vitamin A can be toxic and the effects of vitamin A on the disease appear to be relatively weak.[4]Studies have explored potential treatment with DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid naturally found in fish.  While DHA is known to play a structural role in retinalcells, more research is needed to determine whether supplements should be recommended.[2]Current research is focused on the development of new treatments includinggene therapy,retinal transplantation, and the use of aretinal prosthesis.Stem celltransplantation would involve the injection and integration of stem cells into the retina, in hopes these cells will replace dead cells and provide the missingenzymesand chemicals needed for sight.  Gene therapy could potentially be used when the disease-causingmutationis known and would aim to restore production of the missing or abnormalprotein.  Studies with retinal prosthetics have tested devices that transform light into electrical signals that can be sent directly to the inner retina and brain, avoiding the diseased part of the outer retina.  Though challenges remain, preliminary research into these technologies has been promising.[2][3]"
Jacobsen syndrome,"There is no cure for Jacobsensyndrome; treatment generally focuses on the specific signs and symptoms present in each individual. Treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of various specialists.Individuals with lowplateletcounts (thrombocytopenia) should be monitored regularly. Blood or platelet transfusions may be necessary before or during surgeries. Surgery may be needed to repair various malformations associated with the condition. Complications of certaincongenital heart defects(such as rapid heartbeat or fluid accumulation) may be treated with a variety of drugs. Respiratory infections should be treated vigorously and early. Because of the risk of bacterial infection of the heart lining (endocarditis) and valves, those with certain heart defects may needantibioticsbefore any surgery.Eye abnormalities may be treated with surgery, glasses, contact lenses, and/or other measures to improve visual problems. Abnormalities of the joints, tendons, muscles, and bones may be treated by orthopedic techniques, potentially in combination with surgery.Physical therapymay help improve coordination and mobility. Early intervention is important to ensure that affected children reach their full potential.[3]"
Trisomy 13,"Treatment fortrisomy13 depends on the affected person's signs and symptoms, and is generally symptomatic and supportive.[3]Surgeries are generally withheld for the first few months of life because of the high mortality rate associated with trisomy 13. Parents and medical personnel must carefully weigh decisions about extraordinary life-prolonging measures against the severity of the neurological and physical defects that are present and the likelihood of post-surgical recovery or prolonged survival.[6]"
Chromosome 15q duplication,"Becausechromosome15qduplicationaffects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this duplication varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, children with delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) may be referred for physical or occupational therapy. Speech therapy may be recommended for children with delayed speech. Certain medications may be prescribed to treatseizures. Special education services are often necessary for children withintellectual disability. Surgery may be required to treat certain physical abnormalities such ascleft palateorcongenital heart defects, if present.[1][2][3]Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
15q13.3 microduplication syndrome,"Treatment for 15q13.3 microduplicationsyndrometypically includesphysical,occupational, andspeech therapies. Children with the syndrome may require extra help in school or other therapies to help manage behavioral challenges such asautism. These therapies may help people with the syndrome reach their full potentials.[1]Other treatments that may be recommended for people with 15q13.3 microduplication syndrome includeantiepileptic drugsto treatseizures.Melatoninmay be recommended to help children with difficulty sleeping (insomnia) sleep at night.[1]"
Chromosome 15q25.2 microdeletion,"Becausechromosome15q25.2 microdeletion affects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for thisdeletionvaries because it depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, babies withcongenitaldiaphragmatic herniamay need surgery. Children with bone or muscle abnormalities and/or delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) may be referred for physical or occupational therapy. Speech therapy may be recommended for children with delayed speech. Certain medications may be prescribed to treatseizures. Because people with this deletion are at risk foranemiaand certain types ofcancer(acute myeloid leukemia,osteosarcoma), they may be screened regularly for these conditions.[1][3]Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
17q12 duplication,"Treatment for 17q12duplicationtypically includesphysical,occupational, andspeechtherapies. Children with the duplication may also require extra help in school. These therapies may help people with the duplication reach their full potentials. Other treatments may include behavioral therapies to manage behavioral differences such asautism.[2]Other treatments that may be recommended for people with 17q12 duplication includeantiepileptic drugsto treatseizures. Evaluations of the eyes, heart, and kidneys may also be recommended to rule out any other health problems.[2]"
Koolen de Vries syndrome,"Treatment depends on the symptoms and may include:[2]Early intervention withphysiotherapyfor feeding problems and motor delayPhysical therapy aimed at strengthening the musclesTherapy to improve development of the child's fine and gross motor skillsSpeech therapy, sign language, pictures and computer touch screens aiming to improve communication skillsEducational programming directed to the specific disabilities identifiedRoutine antiepileptic drugsOrthopedic care forscoliosis, hip dislocation, and positional deformities of the feetStandard treatment for cardiac, renal, urologic, and other medical issuesSurgery  cryptorchidism if indicated.Affected people should have routine examinations by a primary care physician andpediatrician,cardiologist,nephrologist, and/orurologist. Referrals to other specialists is indicated if neurological or other problems are suspected.[2][5]"
Chromosome 18p duplication,"Because the presence and severity of signs and symptoms vary from person to person, treatment also varies. If anintellectual disabilityand/ordevelopmental delayis present, early educational intervention and early services are important.It is essential to work with one's person's health care provider and medical team to determine the appropriate medical management plan."
Ring chromosome 20,"Treatment of ringchromosome20 is typically focused on management ofseizures. The seizures associated with ring chromosome 20 do not generally respond well to medications. The treatment that is successful varies from person to person. ‘Broad spectrum’ AEDs are usually tried first since they are active against different seizure types. This includesvalproate,levetiracetam,lamotrigine,topiramateandzonisamide. Success has been reported in some people with a combination of valproate and lamotrigine, but so far no single therapy has worked for everyone.Vagus nerve stimulation(VNS) has been tried and a reduction in seizures has beenreported in some cases but not in others. This involves implanting a medical deviceunder the skin, similar to a pacemaker that delivers a mild electrical current to the brain via the vagus nerve. The long-term effectiveness of VNS therapy is not yet known.Theketogenic diet, which is high in fat and low in carbohydrate, has been shown to behelpful in other types ofepilepsy. However there are no published reports about whether this is successful or not in ring chromosome 20 epilepsy.[2]For more information on treatment of seizures in people with R20 and general information on ring chromosome 20, visit the following link fromUnique, The RareChromosome DisorderSupport Group, a non-profit organization that supports chromosomal disorders.http://www.rarechromo.org/information/Chromosome%2020/Ring%2020%20FTNW.pdf"
Chromosome 3p- syndrome,"Becausechromosome3p-syndromeaffects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for thisdeletionvaries based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, children with delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) and/or muscle problems may be referred for physical or occupational therapy. Severe feeding difficulties may be treated temporarily with anasogastric tubeor agastrostomy tubeto ensure that a baby or child gets enough nutrients. Certain medications may be prescribed to treatseizures. Special education services are often necessary for children withintellectual disability. Surgery may be required to treat certain physical abnormalities such ascleft palateorcongenital heart defects, if present.[2][3]Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
Chromosome 3p deletion,"Becausechromosome3pdeletionaffects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this deletion varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, babies withcongenital heart defectsand certain skeletal abnormalities may require surgery. Afeeding tubemay be recommended in infants with feeding difficulties who have trouble putting on weight. Children with bone or muscle problems and/or delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) may be referred for physical or occupational therapy. Certain medications may be prescribed to treatseizures. Special education services are often necessary for children withintellectual disability.[1][2][5]"
Chromosome 4q deletion,"Becausechromosome4qdeletionaffects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this deletion varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, babies withcongenital heart defectsand certain skeletal abnormalities may require surgery. Children with bone or muscle problems and/or delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) may be referred for physical or occupational therapy. Certain medications may be prescribed to treatseizures. Special education services are often necessary for children withintellectual disability.[5][2][4]Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
Chromosome Xq duplication,"BecausechromosomeXqduplicationaffects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this duplication varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example,parenteral nutritionand/or other dietary interventions may be recommended for infants and young children with feeding difficulties to prevent poor growth andmalnutrition. Children with a speech and/or language delay or other problems with communication may be referred for speech and communication therapy. Medications may be prescribed to treatseizures. Children with delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) may be referred for physical or occupational therapy.Prophylacticantibioticsmay be considered in people with frequent infections.[4]Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
