Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Oral lichen planus,"It is important to identify and remove any potential agent that might have caused a lichenoid reaction.[4]Chemicals or medications associated with development of lichen planus include gold,antibiotics,arsenic, iodides, chloroquine, quinacrine,quinidine, antimony, phenothiazines, diuretics such aschlorothiazide, and many others.[1]Consideration regarding role of drugs that were started in recent months prior to the on set of oral lichen planus, as well as any contact allergens identified by patch testing is recommended.[4]Symptoms may improve with the following measures:[4]Meticulous oral hygieneStopping smokingTopical steroids as drops, pastes, gels or sprays (e.g.,triamcinolonepaste)Steroid injections (intralesional triamcinolone)Mouth rinse containing the calcineurin inhibitors:cyclosporinortacrolimusIn severe cases systemiccorticosteroidsmay be used.[4]Other possible therapeutic agents may include:[4]ThalidomideSystemic retinoids (acitretinorisotretinoin)GriseofulvinAzathioprineCyclophosphamideDapsoneMetronidazoleLow molecular weight heparin"
Orbital varix,"Most people with orbital varices experience little too few symptoms and require no treatment.[4]Occasionally progressive eye pain, eye bulging, compression of theoptic nerve, vision loss and/or disfigurement develops and prompts treatment.[4][5][6]There are no well established guidelines for treatment. Treatment is individually tailored to the patient. People seeking treatment for obital varices benefit from a consultation with a team of doctors, such as an opthalmologist, neurosurgeon, and/or neurointerventional radiologist.[4][5]Treatment with electrothrombosis (the use of an electrical current to block blood flow to the varix),[5]stereotacticgamma knife radiosurgery[4],sclerotherapy, surgical resection, and embolization (blocking of blood flow through the varix) withcyanoacrylateglue followed by excision have been described in the medical literature.[5]"
Osteomyelitis,"The primary aim of treatment is to address the infection and reduce damage to the affected bone.Antibioticsor anti-fungal medications may be given to destroy thebacteriaor fungi that are causing the infection.[1][3]Depending on the severity of the condition, surgery may also be needed to remove dead bonetissue. Surgical procedures may involve drainage of the infected area, removal of diseased bone and tissue, restoration of blood flow, or removal of foreign material.[2][3][4]"
Ovarian cancer,"The best treatment options for ovariancancerdepend on many factors including thesubtypeandstageof the condition. In general, treatment may include a combination of the following:[3][4][5]Surgery to remove the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the uterus, and/or other structures in the belly (pelvis).ChemotherapyRadiation therapyTargeted therapy(such asmonoclonal antibodytherapy)Unfortunately, research suggests that there are no benefits of ovarian cancerscreening(using aCA-125blood test andtransvaginal ultrasound), even in women who are at an elevated risk due to their personal and/or family histories.[8]Women who are at a high-risk for ovarian cancer may, therefore, want to discuss other preventative measures, such asprophylacticsurgery, with their healthcare provider. In women with a known hereditary cancersyndrome, management should also include screening for the other component cancers. Please click on the following links for more information regarding the treatment and management of each condition:Hereditary Breast and Ovarian CancerLynch syndromePeutz-Jeghers syndrome"
Ovarian remnant syndrome,"Treatment for ovarian remnantsyndrome(ORS) is generally indicated for women with suspected ORS who have symptoms (such aspelvicpain); have a pelvic mass; or need or desire complete removal oftissueto decrease the risk of ovariancancer(for example, BRCAmutationcarriers). The mainstay of treatment is surgery to remove the residual ovarian tissue. Women with ORS with a pelvic mass should have appropriate evaluation for malignancy (cancer). Hormonal therapy to suppress ovarian function is an alternative treatment for those who refuse surgery, or those who are not candidates for surgery.[1]"
Ovarian small cell carcinoma,"There are no standard recommendations guiding the treatment of ovarian smallcellcarcinoma. Some authors suggest that treatment should be similar to that of other small cell carcinomas. This might include surgery to remove thetumoror tumors if appropriate,chemotherapy, andradiation therapy. Many different chemotherapy drugs have been utilized with varying rates of success including but not limited to:carboplatin,paclitaxel,vinblastine,cyclophosphamide,bleomycin,doxorubicin, andetoposide.[5]"
Polyarteritis nodosa,"There is no cure for polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), but the disease and its symptoms can be managed. The goal of treatment is to prevent disease progression and furtherorgandamage.[6]The exact treatment depends on the severity in each person.[7]While many people do well with treatment, relapses can occur.[6]When the cause of PAN is unknown (idiopathic), treatment involvescorticosteroidsand immunosuppressive medications.[6]If there are no serious neurologic, renal, gastrointestinal, or heart symptoms, corticosteroids may initially be sufficient. For severe disease with these symptoms,cyclophosphamidemay also be used.Hypertensionshould be treated aggressively.[7]When PAN is related to hepatitis B, treatment often involves steroids, anti-viral medications and sometimes plasma exchange (also calledplasmapheresis).[6]"
VIPoma,"Treatment for VIPoma may includeintravenous(IV) fluids to correct dehydration, medications such asoctreotideto help control diarrhea, and surgery to remove thetumor.[1]If the tumor has spread (metastasized) to the liver or othertissues, treatment may involvechemotherapy,radiofrequency ablation, orhepatic artery embolization.[2][3][4][5]"
"Pancreatitis, pediatric","All families with children with pediatric pancreatitis should work with their child's health care team in developing a treatment plan. For cases of uncomplicated acute pediatric pancreatitis the aims of treatment are to relieve pain and stabilize the child’s metabolism. Pain medication is given and fluid, electrolyte, and mineral balance is restored and maintained.[1]"
PANDAS,"The treatment of PANDAS is symptomatic. Children who are diagnosed with agroup A streptococcal infectionare typically treated withantibioticswhether or not they develop symptoms of PANDAS.Obsessive-compulsive disordersare usually managed with medications (i.e. SSRI medications such asfluoxetine,fluvoxamine,sertaline, orparoxetine) andcognitive behavioral therapy. Tic disorders are often treated with a variety of medications, as well.[4][5]Some researchers suspect that therapies such as plasmapheresis and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which are often used to treatautoimmune disorders, may be a treatment option for children with PANDAS. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removesantibodiesfrom the blood. IVIG can sometimes be used to alter the function or production of abnormal antibodies. Although some studies have demonstrated that both of these therapies are effective for the treatment of severe, strep triggered OCD and tics, a number of the children in these studies experienced severe side-effects. Thus, these treatments are often reserved for severely affected children who do not respond to other therapies.[4][5]"
Warthin tumor,"Treatment of Warthintumorgenerally includes surgery to remove the tumor or careful observation to watch for changes in the tumor over time. Because Warthin tumor is almost alwaysbenign, additional treatment (i.e.radiation therapyand/orchemotherapy) is rarely needed.[1][3]"
Parkes Weber syndrome,"No cure currently exists. Treatment depends on the symptoms and usually involves several specialists, such as interventional radiologist, neurosurgeons,vascular surgeons,cardiologistsanddermatologists. Heart problems should be treated by a cardiologist. The arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and/or arteriovenous fistulas are treated with surgery or with embolization. Leg differences are treated by anorthopedist. Capillary malformations can be treated by a dermatologist when the patients are concerned with the cosmetic appearance.[3]Supportive care may include compression garments (tight-fitting pieces of clothing on the affected limb to reduce pain and swelling); these may also protect the limb from bumps and scrapes, which can cause bleeding and are also recommended in cases of lymphedema. Heel inserts may be used if the legs are different lengths, which can aid in walking normally. Various pain medications andantibioticmedications may be prescribed as needed.[1]"
Patterson-Stevenson-Fontaine syndrome,"Treatment of Patterson-Stevenson-Fontainesyndromefocuses on the specific symptoms present in each person. Surgeries may be available to treat some of the features of the syndrome, such ascleft palateorsyndactyly. However, surgery is not available for all features of the syndrome. For people who havehearing loss,hearing aidsmay be available.[3]"
Patulous Eustachian Tube,"While no standard treatment has been found to work for every patient, there are several options that have been used to successfully manage the symptoms in a number of individuals. Patients are often advised to recline or lower the head between the knees when symptoms occur. They may also be advised to avoid diuretics and/or increase weight. Nasal sprays, drops, or topical nasal administration of medications containing anticholinergics,estrogen, diluted hydrochloric acid, chlorobutanol, or benzyl alcohol may work in reducing symptoms in some patients. Surgical treatment may be indicated in some cases.[1]Information detailing treatment options can be accessed throughMedscape Reference.Areview article from 2015also summarizes what is known about the effectiveness of currently available treatments."
Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency,"The goal of the treatment for pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency is to stimulate the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to produce as much energy as possible. This can prevent immediate worsening of the disease.[1][4]Treatment options typically include supplementingcofactorsincludingcarnitine,thiamine, andlipoic acid. These are substances in the body that help the chemical reactions in thecellsoccur.[1]Certain genetic changes (mutationsor pathogenic variants) that cause PDC deficiency may be more responsive to thiamine treatment than others.[7]A medication calleddichloroacetatemay help treat some people with PDC deficiency. Doctors may also recommend a diet that is high in fats and low incarbohydrates(ketogenic diet). This can help prevent lactic acidosis but typically does not stop neurological symptoms.[1]Medications to help preventseizuresmay be recommended for some people with PDC deficiency.[8]"
Pearson syndrome,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for Pearsonsyndrome, and the goal of treatment is to decrease the seriousness of symptoms so the child can live as healthy and as long of a life as possible. Children affected by Pearson syndrome may require frequentblood transfusionsto help supply the body with healthyred blood cells. Pancreaticenzymereplacement may also help to replace the missing enzymes needed to digest food, or insulin injections may be necessary to treat diabetes. It is important that children affected by Pearson syndrome avoid other people who are sick with viral or bacterial infections, as these children cannot fight off illnesses as well as other children can.[1][2][5]Other treatments depend on the specific symptoms presented by each person with Pearson syndrome. It may be necessary to see specialists for the liver, kidneys, heart, and pancreas. Physical or occupational therapy may be helpful, especially in children who live past infancy.[1][2][3]Unfortunately, astem cell transplanthas not been shown to be helpful in curing a disease that affects many systems in the body like Pearson syndrome does. It is, however, important to ask your doctors about any new or promising treatments for Pearson syndrome.[1]"
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease,"There is no cure for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, nor is there a standard course of treatment.[2][4]Management typically involves a multidisciplinary team made of specialists in neurology, physical medicine, orthopedics, pulmonary medicine, and gastroenterology. Management tactics may includegastrostomyfor individuals with severedysphagia; antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) forseizures; and routine management ofspasticityincludingphysical therapy, exercise, medications (baclofen,diazepam,tizanidine, botulinumtoxin), orthotics, and surgery for jointcontractures. Individuals withscoliosismay benefit from proper wheelchair seating and physical therapy, with surgery reserved for the most severe cases. Specialized education and assessments are generally necessary, and assisted communication devices may be helpful.[3]"
Pemphigus,"Treatment of pemphigus may consist of three phases: control, consolidation, and maintenance. The control phase involves intense therapy  until no new lesions develop. In the consolidation phase, therapy continues until existing lesions have cleared. In the maintenance phase, medications are gradually reduced to the lowest possible dose that prevents the development of new lesions.[5]Different medications may be used alone or in combination depending on the severity in each person.[6]Medications that may be used to treat pemphigus include:[6][5][1][7]Corticosteroids- topical corticosteroids may be enough for people with mild pemphigus, but many people need systemic (oral) corticosteroids.Immunosuppressants - these prevent theimmune systemfrom mistakenly attacking healthytissue. Examples includeazathioprine,methotrexate,mycophenolate,cyclophosphamide, andcyclosporine.Rituximab- this is an injection that may be used if other medications are causing serious side effects or are ineffective. It is a biologic therapy that targets thecellsresponsible for making pemphigusantibodies.IVIG(intravenous immune globulin)- this is an intravenous treatment that may be given over the course of several days.Plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange) - this is a therapy that removes the responsible antibodies from the blood."
Pemphigus vulgaris,"The aim of treatment in pemphigus vulgaris is to decrease blister formation and promote healing of blisters and scarring. It is important to determine the minimal dose of medication necessary to control the disease process. Treatment is individualized, and takes into account the patient's other health conditions.[3][1]The medications that might be used to treat pemphigus vulgaris include:[3]Corticosteroidshave improved the outcome of the disease, but because the use is for a long time there may be many adverse effects.Immunosuppressive drugs such asrituximab,sulfasalazine,pentoxifylline,methotrexate, anddapsoneIntravenous immunoglobulin therapyInfliximabPhotodynamic therapyMizoribine has been used for problems in the eye caused by the disease."
Tarlov cysts,"While there is no standard accepted treatment for individuals with symptomatic Tarlov cysts, many different therapies have been tried.[3]Tarlov cysts may be drained and shunted to relieve pressure and pain, but relief is often only temporary and fluid build-up in the cysts will recur.Corticosteroidinjections may also temporarily relieve pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may be prescribed to treat chronic pain and inflammation. Injecting the cysts with fibrin glue (a combination of naturally occurring substances based on the clotting factor in blood) may provide temporary relief of pain. Microsurgical removal of the cyst wall may be an option in select individuals who do not respond to conservative treatments and who continue to experience pain or progressive neurological damage.[1][3][4]Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) has been proven useful for some in pain management. TENS devices deliver electrical impulses through the skin to the nerves to control pain. Unlike medications and topical ointments, TENS does not have any known side effects, other than skin irritation from the electrodes in some patients.[4]A recent review analyzed the different surgical options, including the following:[2]Sacral laminectomy with microsurgical cyst fenestration and cyst imbricationSacral laminectomy with resection of the sacral cystMicrosurgical excision of the cyst along with duraplasty or plication of the cystRelease of the valve and imbrication of the sacral cysts with laminectomiesTotal or partial cyst wall removal, arranging the remaining nerve sheath, and repairing the local defect with muscle, gelfoam and fibrin glueRemoving of the cyst and closure of defect by fibrin glueMicroscopic cyst resection and closure of defect by fibrin glueMicrosurgical fenestration from the cyst to the thecal sacFenestration of the cyst and closure of the opening by stitches and glueCyst remodeling around the root using titanium clipsCyst excision and occlusion of its neck.The authors of this review concluded that the best results are obtained with the complete removal of the cyst and closure of the defect by fibrin glue, microscopic cyst resection and closure of the defect by fibrin glue, or cyst removal with closure of its neck.[2]"
Restless legs syndrome,"Treatment for restless legssyndrome(RLS) may involve medication and/or finding other ways to relieve symptoms. In some cases, treating an associated medical condition (such as diabetes orperipheral neuropathy) may be effective in controlling symptoms of RLS.[2]Medications are usually helpful but no single medication is effective for all people with RLS. Therefore, trying different medications may be necessary. Common drugs prescribed to treat RLS include:[2]Dopaminergic agents(drugs that increase dopamine, often used for Parkinson disease) - have been shown to reduce symptoms of RLS when taken at bedtime and are considered the initial treatment of choice. However, long-term use can lead to worsening of  symptoms, which is then reversible by stopping the medicationBenzodiazepines (""depressants"" often used for anxiety, muscle spasms or insomnia) - may help obtain a more restful sleep, but can sometimes cause daytime sleepinessOpioidssuch as codeine, propoxyphene, or oxycodone may be prescribed at night to diminish pain and help with relaxationAnticonvulsants - can decrease the sensations such as creeping and crawling and nerve painThe Relaxis pad - an FDA-approved medical device that can be placed at the site of discomfort when in bed and provides 30 minutes of vibrationsThe following non-pharmacologic therapies may help to relieve symptoms of RLS:[2]For temporary relief: moving the affected limb(s); massaging the legs; taking a hot bath; or using a heating pad or ice packMaking lifestyle changes such as decreasing the use of caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco; changing or maintaining a regular sleep pattern; getting moderate exerciseTaking supplements to correct deficiencies in iron, folate, and magnesium"
Periventricular heterotopia,"Treatment ofepilepsygenerally follows principles for aseizuredisorder caused by a known structural brain abnormality. Carbamezipine is most often used, because most people with this condition have focal seizures. However, the choice of antiepileptic drug may be selected based on side effects, tolerability, and efficacy.[1]It is recommended that people with theX-linkedform of the condition have studies evaluating the carotid artery and an abdominalultrasound, due to the risk for aortic or carotid dissection or other vascular anomalies.[1]Treatment may also include surgery for removal of the lesion and more recently, laser ablation guided with magnetic resonance.[3][4]"
Trichohepatoenteric syndrome,"Trichohepatoentericsyndromeis treated symptomatically, meaning it is focused on treating the symptoms of the disease. Treating the chronic diarrhea is often the biggest concern, as chronic diarrhea can prevent people with trichohepatoenteric syndrome from getting enough nutrients. In most cases, treatment requires nutrition through an intravenous line, or IV. This is also calledparenteral nutrition.[1]If the liver disease associated with trichohepatoenteric syndrome permanently damages the liver, a partial or complete liver transplant may be required.[2]It may also be necessary to treat the weakenedimmune systemassociated with trichohepatoenteric syndrome. People with the condition may need treatment such asimmunoglobulin infusionsto boost the immune system.[4]"
Pheochromocytoma,"The recommended treatment of a pheochromocytoma is removal by surgery, even in cases where there are pheochromocytomas in bothadrenal glands.[3]Prior to surgery, it is important to take medications to control and stabilize blood pressure.  Following surgery, affected individuals should visit their physicians regularly to monitor blood pressure and blood levels ofmetanephrine.[1][4]Long-term treatment with medication should only be considered if, for some reason, the pheochromocytoma cannot be removed by surgery.[1]"
Sitosterolemia,"The primary goal of treatment is to reduce the concentration of plant sterols in the blood (to below 1 mg/dl, if possible). Sitosterolemia can be managed by restricting floods that have a high concentration of plant and shellfish sterols, and with the use of medications. Foods with high plant sterols include vegetable oils, margarine, nuts, seeds, avocados, and chocolate. The drugezetimibemay be used to decrease the plant sterol concentration in blood.Cholestyraminehas also been used in some individuals.[2][3]If medications don't work, partial ileal bypass surgery may be considered.[3]GeneReviewsoffers additional details about management."
PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum,"Unfortunately, there is no cure forPIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). However, there are treatment options that can help manage symptoms of thesyndromes. People withovergrowthmay be treated with surgery to remove growths that are impacting movement. Surgery may also be necessary if there is too much pressure on the brain or to treat skeletal symptoms such asscoliosis. Medications may be used to treatseizures(epilepsy).[1]Researchers are investigating other potential medications that may be used to treat PROS.[5][6]People with PROS may be followed by a multi-disciplinary team that may include aneurologist,cardiologist,nephrologist(doctor that helps manage kidney problems), and anorthopedist. Other treatment options may includespeech therapy,physical therapy, andspecial educationin school.[1]"
Pineal cyst,"The best treatment options for pineal cysts depend on many factors, including the size of the cyst and whether or not it is associated with symptoms. For example, small cysts that do not cause symptoms do not require any treatment.[4]Treatment may be recommended if the cyst causes symptoms. Depending on the size of the cyst and the symptoms present, treatment may involve open orstereotacticremoval of the cyst, stereotactic aspiration, and/orCSF diversion or shunting(a procedure used to drain fluid from the brain).Radiation therapymay be considered for cysts that recur after treatment.[4]"
Pineocytoma,"Because pineocytomas are quite rare, there are no consensus guidelines on the best treatment for thesetumors.[4]However, surgery to remove the entire tumor is considered the standard treatment. Because these tumors are located deep in the brain, it is important that the risks of surgery be carefully considered in each person.[3]Radiation therapyis sometimes used following surgery to destroy any tumorcellsthat may remain, but the benefit of this additional treatment is questionable.[4]"
Pineoblastoma,"Standard treatment for pineoblastoma begins with surgery to remove as much of thetumoras possible.  Surgery is followed byradiation therapy, which aims to destroy anycancercellsthat may remain near the original location of the tumor, andchemotherapy, which is designed to kill any cancer cells that may have traveled to other parts of the body.[6]"
Pityriasis lichenoides,"Most cases of pityriasis lichenoides (PL) tend to resolve on their own over time.[2]However, treatment may be used to decrease the duration of the condition, especially if the rash is a nuisance.[1]Initial treatment for PL usually consists of topical or systemiccorticosteroids, or oralantibiotics. However, these treatments may cause multiple side effects and are not always effective.[5]Natural sunlight and/orphototherapytreatment may be helpful. A combination of tablets known as Psoralens with UVA (PUVA treatment) may also be helpful, but carries a higher risk of side effects. Severe forms of the disease may be managed by medications that suppress the immune response (immunosuppressants).[1]Information about specific medications that may be used to treat PL is available on Medscape Reference's website here."
Pityriasis lichenoides chronica,"In some cases, pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) may fade over time without requiring any treatment. In other cases, people with PLC may want treatment because there are many papules that are taking a long time to fade. Possible therapies that may be used to treat PLC include:[1][2]Exposure to sunlight while carefully avoiding sunburnSteroid creamsOralantibioticsPhototherapyPhotochemotherapy: a treatment that uses a combination ofpsoralensandultraviolet radiationIf these therapies do not help treat PLC, other treatments may be used includingoral steroidsandimmunosuppressants.[1][2]In some cases, PLC may not respond to treatment, and relapses may occur. If the papules do return, close follow-up with adermatologistis recommended.[2]More information about specific medications that may be used to treat PLC is available on Medscape Reference’s website."
Pityriasis rotunda,"There is no specific treatment for pityriasis rotunda. People diagnosed with this condition usually need to undergo medical and physical examinations and have appropriate laboratory and radiographic tests to check for internal disease or malignancies. The lesions usually improve or resolve with treatment of the underlying internal disease or malignancy. Symptomatic treatment of lesions usingtopical retinoids,salicylic acid ointment, andlactic acid lotionhas been used.[1]However, the lesions can be resistant to therapy.[2]"
Pityriasis rubra pilaris,"PRP can be difficult to treat and many treatment options have been tried. There is little information on which treatments are best because none have been studied in largeclinical trials. Treatment options may vary based on the symptoms in each person but often involve a combination of medicines taken internally and applied topically to the skin.[2]Topical therapy options may includecorticosteroids, keratolytics,calcipotriol,tretinoin, andtazarotene. For people with mild PRP, using one or more of these may be enough to control symptoms.[4]Most people with PRP also need additional medicines to control their symptoms, especially if the condition affects a large part of the body.[4]Oral retinoidsare usually tried first.[4]Examples includeacitretinandisotretinoin.[5]Methotrexate, animmune systemsuppressant, may be tried when oral retinoids are not safe for a particular person, or when they have stopped working.[4]Other immune system suppressants that have been helpful in some case reports includecyclosporineandazathioprine.[4][5]Biologic therapiesmay be another option, based on limited data. Examples include variousbiologic TNF-alpha inhibitorsandustekinumab.[5]For more detailed information about treatment options for PRP, you can view information fromMedscape Referenceor theNational Organization for Rare Disorders(NORD).Many of these treatments have shown results in only a few patients, and some can have serious side effects. The risks and benefits of each treatment option should be discussed with your doctor."
Pyruvate kinase deficiency,"Mild cases require no treatment. People with severeanemiamay need blood transfusions.  In newborns with dangerous levels ofjaundice, a health care provider may recommend anexchange transfusion. Surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may also be necessary to help reduce the destruction ofred blood cells. However, this does not help in all cases. With small children, this is delayed as long as possible to allow theimmune systemto mature. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Someone who had a splenectomy should receive thepneumococcal vaccineat recommended intervals. They also should receive preventiveantibioticsuntil age 5.[2][1]An article from eMedicine Journal provides additional information on treatment for pyruvate kinase deficiency at the following link. You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free.http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/125096-treatment#showall"
Platelet storage pool deficiency,"Treatment forplateletstorage pool deficiency is symptomatic. For example, people who have severe episodes of bleeding may require platelettransfusionsorantifibrinolytic medications, particularly during periods of high risk such as during surgical procedures or after an injury. Transfusions are generally used with caution as the potential risks often outweigh the benefits when bleeding is not life-threatening.[1][3]People with a platelet storage pool deficiency should avoid antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).[1][3]"
