Alkaptonuria,"There is no cure for alkaptonuria, but there is treatment for some individual signs and symptoms of the condition. Joint pain may be substantial in individuals with alkaptonuria, and close attention to pain control is usually necessary. Physical and occupational therapy can be important to promote muscle strength and flexibility.Knee, hip, and shoulder replacement surgeriesmay be options for managing significantarthritis. In general, however, the goal of joint replacement is pain relief rather than increased range of motion. Maintaining joint range of motion through moderate non-weight-bearing exercise such as swimming may have beneficial effects. Treatment of prostate stones andrenal stonesmay include surgery.[4]No therapy has proven to prevent or correct the pigmentary changes ofochronosis.[4]Dietary restriction of phenylalanine and tyrosine has been proposed to reduce the production of HGA, but severe restriction of theseamino acidsis not practical in the long term and may be dangerous.[4]"
Alagille syndrome,"Many doctors may be necessary for the best management of Alagillesyndrome, including specialists in medical genetics, gastroenterology (for digestive system and liver problems), nephrology (for kidney problems), nutrition, cardiology (for heart problems), ophthalmology (for eye problems), liver transplantation, and child development. Treatment may include:[1][2][4][5][6][7][8]Medication that increases bile flow (ursodeoxycholic acid) and that reduces the itching, such ascholestyramine,rifampin, andnaltrexone.Biliary diversion procedures (partial internal biliary diversion and ileal exclusion) that interrupt the normal bile circulation between the intestines and liver resulting in the bile being eliminated and therefore lowering the blood bile levels. These procedures relieve symptoms of liver disease, such as itching, and improve the quality of life, but do not prevent the progression of liver disease.Vitamin and special nutrition supplementation to support proper growth and development. Infants with Alagille syndrome are given a special formula that helps the small intestine absorb the fats. The diet usually is a high-calorie diet, calcium, and with vitamins A, D, E, and K, and sometimes  zinc. Sometimes a  child may receive additional calories through a tiny tube that is passed through the nose into the stomach. If extra calories are needed for a long time, a doctor may place a tube, called a gastrostomy tube, directly into the stomach through a small opening made in the abdomen. Nutrition management may need to continue throughout a person's lifetime, but especially during childhood, with careful monitoring and balancing of nutrients, fat, calories, fat-soluble vitamins, calcium, and zinc. Each person with Alagille syndrome may have different dietary needs and the needs may change throughout their lifetime, so regular consultation with a nutrition specialists is recommended.Liver Transplantationto increase life span and improve liver function for those with end stage liver disease. Although there is some catch-up growth after a liver transplant in children with Alagille syndrome, it is not as much as seen in children with other liver diseases.Heart surgeryor acatheter based procedureto correct a heart defect. Heart problems are treated the same as similar heart problems in children who do not have Alagille syndrome (standard medical care) although may be complicated if otherorgansare affected by the syndrome.Kidney surgery or treatment to correct any kidney abnormalities. Kidney problems are treated the same as kidney problems in children who do not have Alagille syndrome (standard medical care), although may be complicated if other organs are affected by the syndrome.Heart problems may complicate liver transplantataion, especially,pulmonary artery stenosis with right ventricular pressure overload.  In these cases a procedure known ascongenital heart transcatheter interventionmay be done before the liver transplant."
Primary hyperoxaluria type 1,"The goal of treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is to minimize calcium oxalate deposition and maintain renal function. Early diagnosis and prompt therapy is critical to preserve the function of the kidneys for as long as possible.General therapies for preventing kidney stones benefit all people with PH1. Recommendations for this include:drinking large amounts of fluidoral potassium citrateto inhibit calcium oxalate crystallizationdrugs such as thiazides to decrease calcium in the urineavoiding significant intake of vitamin C or D (they promote stone formation)supplementation of dietary calciumTreatment for kidney stones may involveshock wave lithotripsy,percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and/orureteroscopy.Reducing the body's production of oxalate involves treatment withpyridoxine. While only about 10%-30% of people with PH1 respond to treatment with pyridoxine, it has been recommended that all people with PH1 receive a minimum 3-month trial at the time of initial diagnosis.Dialysisto remove oxalate in people with PH1 has limitations, but may be indicated in specific circumstances in some people with PH1.Lastly,organtransplantation is an option for therapy. There has been much discussion among experts regarding the best transplantation strategy for people with PH1. Depending on each person's response to other therapies and the disease severity, options may include combined liver-kidney transplant; sequential liver-kidney transplant; an isolated kidney transplant, or an isolated liver transplant.[2]Other therapies for PH1 are under investigation and may become options for people with PH1 in the future.People with questions about the treatment of PH1 for themselves or family members should speak with their doctor for treatment options and advice."
Osteopetrosis,"Treatment for osteopetrosis depends on the specific symptoms present and the severity in each person. Therefore, treatment options must be evaluated on an individual basis.Nutritional support is important to improve growth and it also enhances responsiveness to other treatment options. A calcium-deficient diet has been beneficial for some affected people.Treatment is necessary for the infantile form:Vitamin D (calcitriol) appears to stimulate dormant osteoclasts, which stimulates bone resorption. Large doses of calcitriol with restricted calcium intake sometimes improves osteopetrosis dramatically, but the improvement seen with calcitrol is not sustained when therapy is stopped.Gammainterferoncan have long-term benefits. It improveswhite blood cellfunction (leading to fewer infections), decreases bone volume, and increases bone marrow volume.Erythropoietincan be used foranemia, andcorticosteroidscan be used for anemia and to stimulate bone resorption.[3]Bone marrow transplantation(BMT) markedly improves some cases of severe, infantile osteopetrosis associated with bone marrow failure, and offers the best chance of longer-term survival for individuals with this type.[3][1]In pediatric (childhood) osteopetrosis, surgery is sometimes needed because of fractures.Adult osteopetrosis typically does not require treatment, but complications of the condition may require intervention. Surgery may be needed for aesthetic or functional reasons (such as multiple fractures, deformity, and loss of function), or for severe degenerative joint disease.[3]"
Albinism,"The goal of treatment is to address the symptoms present in each individual. People with albinism should protect their skin and eyes from the sun. This can be done by:[2][3]avoiding prolonged exposure to the sun,using sunscreen with a high SPF rating (20 or higher),covering up completely with clothing when exposed to the sun, andwearing sunglasses with UV protection.Individuals with vision problems may need corrective lenses. They should also have regular follow-up exams with anophthalmologist. In rare cases, surgery may be needed. Individuals with albinism should also have regular skin assessments to screen for skincanceror lesions that can lead to cancer.[1]"
Oculocutaneous albinism,"Individuals with oculocutaneous albinism should have annual skin examinations to check for skin damage or skincancerand annual eye examination to check vision.  Affected individuals should cover their skin from sun exposure by using sunscreen and wearing protective clothing such as long-sleeve shirts, long pants, and hats with wide brims.  Glasses may be worn to reduce sensitivity to bright light or to improve vision.  Additional therapies or surgery may be used to treatcrossed eyes(strabismus) or rapid eye movements (nystagmus).[2][3][4]"
McCune-Albright syndrome,"Management of McCune-Albrightsyndrome(MAS) is most effective with a multidisciplinary team of specialists includingorthopedistsandendocrinologists. Although there is no cure for MAS, drug treatments or surgery may help some of the endocrine symptoms, and surgery may help to manage bone problems that cause visual disturbance, severe pain, or severe disfigurement.[4][6]Generally, treatment depends on whattissuesare affected as well as the severity.[2]Bisphosphonatesare frequently used to treat fibrous dysplasia. Strengthening exercises are recommended to help maintain strength around the bones and minimize the risk of fractures.[2][6]More detailed information about the management of MAS is available on Medscape Reference's website."
Hereditary fructose intolerance,"Complete elimination of fructose and sucrose from the diet is an effective treatment for most people,[1]although this can be challenging. More information on treatment for HFI is available from theHFI Laboratory at Boston Universityat the following link. This page includes information on what people with HFI can and cannot eat.http://www.bu.edu/aldolase/HFI/treatment/Additional information on foods to avoid if you have HFI is available from the Mayo clinic.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fructose-intolerance/AN01574"
Alexander disease,"No specific therapy is currently available for Alexander disease. Management is supportive and includes attention to general care, physical and occupational therapy, nutritional requirements,antibiotictreatment for any infection, and antiepileptic drugs (AED) forseizurecontrol.[4]Physical and occupational therapy and speech therapy may be recommended depending on the specific signs and symptoms present. Physical and occupational therapy may be indicated in people with developmental and language delays."
