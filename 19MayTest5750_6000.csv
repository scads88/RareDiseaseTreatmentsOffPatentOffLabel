Polymyositis,"The treatment of polymyositis is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Although there is currently no cure, symptoms of the disease may be managed with the following:[2][7]Medications such ascorticosteroids, corticosteroid-sparing agents, or immunosuppressive drugsPhysical therapyto improve muscle strength and flexibilitySpeech therapyto address difficulties with swallowing and speechIntravenous immunoglobulin: an infusion of healthyantibodiesthat are given to block damagingautoantibodiesthat attack the muscleMescape Referenceoffers more specific information regarding thediagnosis and treatment of polymyositis."
Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1,"Treatment for pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1) is aimed at treating the signs and symptoms present in each individual. Management options may includephysical therapyor braces on the limbs to help withjoint contractures,ventilation machinesfor breathing assistance, anti-seizuremedication, and afeeding tubeif the child is not able to eat without one.[4]These treatment options are aimed at relieving some of the symptoms of PCH1, but there is no cure for the disease.[2][5]"
Porokeratosis of Mibelli,"Treatment depends on the size, location, and aggressiveness of porokeratosis of Mibelli.  Affected individuals are recommended to visit their personal physician regularly to watch for signs of skincancer, limit sun exposure to the affected area, and use moisturizers as needed.[2]Imiquimodcream has been found to be an effective treatment, as has5-fluorouracil cream.  A group of medications called retinoids (includingacitretinandisotretinoin), as a pill or cream, may be another treatment option.[2]If a skin cancer develops from porokeratosis of Mibelli, surgery is recommended.[1]"
Punctate porokeratosis,"Treatment depends on the size, location, and aggressiveness of punctate porokeratosis.  Affected individuals are recommended to visit their personal physician regularly to watch for signs of skincancer, limit sun exposure to the affected area, and use moisturizers as needed.[2]5-fluorouracil creamhas been found to be an effective treatment.  A group of medications called retinoids (includingacitretinandisotretinoin), as a pill or cream, may be another treatment option.[2]If a skin cancer develops from porokeratosis, surgery is recommended.[1]"
Variegate porphyria,"Acute attacks are managed and may be prevented as in acute intermittent porphyria.[1][2]Hospitalization is often necessary for acute attacks. Medications for pain, nausea and vomiting, and close observation are generally required. A high intake of glucose or other carbohydrates can help suppress disease activity and can be given by vein or by mouth. Intravenous heme therapy is more potent in suppressing disease activity. It can be started after a trial of glucose therapy. However, the response to heme therapy is best if started early in an attack. Heme must be administered by vein.Panhematinis the only commercially available heme therapy for treatment and prevention of acute porphyric attacks in the United States. Heme arginate, which is marketed in some other countries, is another preparation of heme for intravenous administration.[5]"
Sheehan syndrome,"Treatment involves replacement of thehormonesproduced by the pituitary gland. The following may be recommended, depending on individual circumstances:[1][2]Estrogenalone (if the uterus has been removed) orestrogen and progesteronein combination. This should be taken at least until the normal age of menopause.Levothyroxineto replace thyroid stimulating hormone. This will need to be taken throughout the lifetime.Corticosteroidsto replace adrenal hormones. These must also be taken throughout the lifetime.Growth hormonemay also be suggested, as this may help normalize the body's muscle-to-fat ratio, maintain bone mass, lower cholesterol levels, and/or improve overall quality of life.The levels of these hormones should be monitored on a regular basis and may need to be adjusted periodically based on factors such as stress level, illness, pregnancy, or changes in weight.[2]"
Prader-Willi syndrome,"A multidisciplinary team approach is ideal for the treatment of people with Prader-Willisyndrome(PWS). Early diagnosis, early multidisciplinary care, and growthhormone treatmenthave greatly improved the quality of life of many affected children. In general, management of this condition depends on the affected person's age and symptoms.[2][3]When a diagnosis of PWS is made, several evaluations are needed to assess the extent of the condition. For example, newborns should be assessed for sucking problems; infants should be assessed for development; and young children should have a vision exam. All males should be evaluated for the presence ofcryptorchidism. Other associated conditions for which evaluations may be recommended includehypothyroidism,scoliosis, behavioral problems, psychosis, and respiratory problems and sleep issues.[2][3]In infants, special feeding techniques may be needed. Young children often need early intervention, includingphysical therapyfor muscle strength and reaching physical milestones, and speech therapy for language issues. Cryptorchidism may resolve on its own but usually requires hormonal and/or surgical treatment. When excessive eating begins and weight percentiles increase, affected children should be on a program of a well-balanced diet, exercise, and close supervision with food. A consultation with adietitianis recommended. Behavioral problems may be addressed with special behavioral management programs. Serotonin uptake inhibitors have helped many affected teenagers and adults, particularly those with obsessive-compulsive symptoms.[2][3]Growth hormone treatment can normalize height, increase lean body mass, increase mobility, and decrease fat mass. Controlled trials of growthhormonetherapies have shown significant benefit from infancy through adulthood. Benefits may include an increase in language and cognitive skills, and better motor performance. Sex hormone replacement helps to produce secondary sex characteristics (those that develop during puberty) but is somewhat controversial due to possible behavior problems in males, risk of stroke, and hygiene concerns related to menstruation in females.[2][3]Clinical trialsinvestigating potential treatment options for people with PWS are ongoing. ClinicalTrials.gov provides patients, family members, and members of the public with current information onclinical research studies for PWS.  Use each study's contact information to learn more."
Preauricular sinus,"The majority of preauricular sinuses do not cause symptoms or problems unless they become infected. Common signs of infection include swelling, redness, fluid drainage, and pain. In these cases, treatment typically includes systemicantibiotics. If anabscessis present, it will likely need to be incised and drained.[2][3]There are differing opinions in the medical literature about the indications for surgical removal of preauricular sinuses. Some believe that even asymptomatic sinuses should be removed. Others believe that surgery is indicated if infection or other complications arise.[2][3]"
Progressive bulbar palsy,"Treatments aim to help people cope with the symptoms of progressive bulbar palsy, such as feeding tubes, devices to help with talking, and medicines to treat muscle spasms, weakness, drooling, sleep problems, pain, and depression.[1][3][2]The Robert Packard Center for ALS Research at John Hopkins offers further general information on treatment:http://www.alscenter.org/what-is-als/treatment/index.htmlThe Mayo Clinic provides information on treatment of ALS in general, which may be helpful:http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/diagnosis-treatment/treatment/txc-20247219If you are interested in learning aboutclinical trials, we recommend that you call the Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison (PRPL) Office at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at 1-800-411-1222.Organizations, such as theALS AssociationandMuscular Dystrophy Associationare great sources for information on clinical trial opportunities and research.You can find information about participating in a clinical trial as well as learn about resources for travel and lodging assistance, through theGet Involved in Researchsection of our Web site."
Progressive deafness with stapes fixation,"Treatment for progressive deafness with stapes fixation be treated typically involves surgery.[1][2]The conductive component of thehearing losscan be restored by surgery or hearing aids. The associated sensorineural component is managed by hearing aids orcochlear implants, depending on its severity.[2]Stapedotomy (a procedure where a laser is used to make a hole in the stapes) or partial stapedectomy (removal of the stapes) with stapes replacement using a prosthesis most commonly achieves satisfactory results with minimal complications.[4][7]"
Progressive transformation of germinal centers,"Because progressivetransformationof germinal centers (PTGC) is considered abenigncondition and usually has no symptoms other than the enlargedlymph node, no treatment is necessary. The enlarged lymph node may stay the same size or shrink over time.[3]Affected individuals should have regular follow-up visits with their physician; abiopsyshould be taken of any new enlarged lymph node because PTGC is associated withHodgkin lymphomain some individuals.[1]"
Protein S deficiency,"Treatment ofproteinS deficiency occurs either in patients who have had a venous thrombosis or in patients with asymptomaticcarrierstates without a thrombotic event, depending on the decisions made by the patient's health care provider. Following a venous thrombosis, patients are treated withanticoagulantdrugs (blood thinners) includingheparinfollowed bywarfarin.  In most patients, specialists recommend 6-9 months of initial treatment with warfarin. The question of whether to continue lifelong warfarin in patients with identified protein S deficiency after their first thrombotic event is controversial. If the first thrombotic event was life threatening or occurred in multiple or unusual sites (i.e. cerebral veins, mesenteric veins), most experts recommend lifelong therapy initially. If brought about especially abruptly by a strong event (i.e. trauma, surgery) and the thrombosis did not meet the criteria of life threatening or multiple or unusual sites, some experts argue that these patients may have a lower risk of recurrence and deserve a trial without warfarin after 9 months.In patients who are asymptomatic carriers of protein S deficiency, the goal of therapy is prevention of the first thrombosis. In such patients, drugs that predispose to thrombosis, including oral contraceptives should be avoided. If these patients require surgery or an orthopedic injury occurs,prophylaxiswith heparin may become necessary.[2]"
Pseudohypoparathyroidism,"The goal of treatment for pseudohypoparathyroidism is to return the levels of calcium and phosphorous to normal. This can be done by taking calcium supplements to increase the level of calcium in the body. Vitamin D supplements also indirectly work to increase calcium levels in the body because vitamin D improves the absorption of calcium.[3]The doctors may also recommend a low-phosphate diet or specific medications that bind to phosphate in the blood and reduce the effects.Because people affected with certain types of pseudohypoparathyroidism may be shorter than other people, growthhormonemay also be a treatment that allows these individuals to grow taller than they otherwise would.[4]"
Pudendal Neuralgia,"Many physicians suggest using a step-ladder approach to therapy for individuals with pudendal neuralgia.Physical therapywith professionals who specialize inpelvicfloor therapy is often the first line of treatment. Electrical stimulation and biofeedback have been used to assist therapists with treatment. Patients are also given exercises and lifestyle modifications to use at home. For muscle spasms that are not responsive to physical therapy,botulinum toxinhas been used in some cases. Medications such asgabapentin,pregabalin,cyclobenzaprine, and tricyclicantidepressantshave also been used in the treatment of patients with PN.[1][2]In some cases, treatment may includenerve blocks,electrical stimulationof the lower end of the spinal cord, or surgery to removetissuesthat might be pressing on the pudendal nerve.[1][2][3]"
Pulmonary sequestration,Traditional treatment of extralobular pulmonary sequestration involves surgical removal via mini-thoracotomy for patients that are experiencing symptoms. Less invasive surgery techniques may include thorascopic surgery andcoil embolization.[5]
Pyoderma gangrenosum,"Althoughantibioticsare often prescribed prior to having a correct diagnosis (and may be continued if there is a secondary infection or surroundingcellulitis), antibiotics are generally not helpful for treating uncomplicated cases of pyoderma gangrenosum.[3]The best documented treatments aresystemic corticosteroidsandcyclosporin A.[4]Smaller ulcers may be treated with strongtopical steroid creams, steroid injections, special dressings, oral anti-inflammatory antibiotics, and/or other therapies. More severe cases typically require immunosuppressive therapy (used to decrease the body's immune responses). Combinations of steroids withcytotoxic drugsmay be used in resistant cases. There has reportedly been rapid improvement of pyoderma gangrenosum with use of anti-tumornecrosis alpha therapy (such asinfliximab), which is also used to treat Crohn's disease and other conditions.[2][3][4]Skin transplantsand/or the application ofbioengineered skinis useful in selected cases as a complementary therapy to immunosuppressive treatment.[4]The use of modern wound dressings is helpful to minimize pain and the risk of secondary infections.[3][4]Treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum generally does not involve surgery because it can result in enlargement of the ulcer; however, necrotictissue(dying or dead tissue) should be gently removed.[3]More detailed information about the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum is available on theTreatmentandMedicationpages of Medscape Reference."
Sideroblastic anemia pyridoxine-refractory autosomal recessive,"Currently there is not a cure for sideroblasticanemiapyridoxine-refractoryautosomal recessive, however with proper treatment the life-expectancy of people with this anemia can be close to normal. Treatments are aimed at preventingorgandamage from iron overload, and controlling symptoms of anemia. People with severe anemia may require periodic transfusions. Transfusions of redcellsare kept to a minimum, to avoid accelerating iron overload.[5]Treatment of iron overload involves an iron depletion program, such as therapeutic phlebotomy or iron chelation.[5]Total splenectomy is contraindicated in this disorder.[5]This form of sideroblastic anemia is not associated with an increased risk for leukemia.[5]A few small studies have described the use of allogenic bone marrow orstem celltransplantation for hereditary andcongenitalforms of sideroblastic anemia. While these therapies may offer the possibility of a cure, the complications associated with transplantation surgery must be considered.[6]All patients with sideroblastic anemia should be followed by ahematologistand avoid alcohol.[1][3]"
ROHHAD,"There is currently no cure for ROHHAD. Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Because ROHHAD can affect many parts of the body, children with ROHHAD are often cared for by a team of healthcare providers who specialize in a variety of medical fields. For example:Children may be referred to nutrition services to help prevent additional weight gain.Hypothalamic dysfunctionis often managed by anendocrinologistwho may recommendhormonereplacement therapy (such as growth hormone), a strict fluid intake regimen, and/or other measures.Children withalveolar hypoventilationwill be referred to apulmonologist(a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of lung conditions) and/or a respiratory therapist who can determine if and whenventilatorsare needed.Due to an increased risk for certain types oftumorsincludingganglioneuromasandganglioneuroblastomas, children with ROHHAD may also be screened periodically for these tumors.Other healthcare providers who may help with the care of a child with ROHHAD includecardiologists,gastroenterologists(doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal conditions),neurologists, nurses, social workers, speech and language therapists, and special education teachers.[2]"
Rasmussen encephalitis,"Anti-epileptic drugs are usually not effective in controlling theseizuresassociated with Rasmussen encephalitis. Recent studies have shown some success with treatments that suppress or modulate theimmune system, in particular those that usecorticosteroids,intravenous immunoglobulin, ortacrolimus. Surgery to control seizures may be performed in later stages of the disease when neurological deficits stabilize. Surgical procedures, such as functional hemispherectomy (removal of half of the brain) and hemispherotomy (a surgical procedure for hemispheric disconnection), may reduce the frequency of seizures and also improve behavior and cognitive abilities.[1]"
Rosai-Dorfman disease,"In many cases, the signs and symptoms of Rosai-Dorfman disease go away without any treatment (spontaneousremission) within months or a few years. When possible, the preferred course of management is continuous observation without treatment. Many individuals will not require therapy, but in some cases, various treatment options may become necessary. Treatment of the condition is then typically directed toward the specific symptoms that the affected individual has. Some individuals may need surgical removal of histiocytic lesions.[4]In more serious cases, treatment options have included therapy with certain drugs including steroids (e.g.,prednisone), alfa-interferon(a man-made copy of aproteinthat is normally made by the body in response to infection),chemotherapyandradiation therapy.[3][4]These treatments have improved symptoms in some individuals, but in others they have not been effective. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[4]"
Shapiro syndrome,"Evaluating effective treatment options for Shapirosyndromecan be difficult because of the limited number of diagnosed cases, the periodic nature of the disease, and other factors. Nonetheless, the following have been attempted and have resulted in varying levels of success:oxcarbazepine,carbamazepine,clonidine,cyproheptadine,glycopyrrolate,bromocriptine,chlorpromazine,beta blockers, orsympathectomy.[1][4]It is recommended that treatment options be discussed with a health care professional. Only a patient's personal health care provider can determine the appropriate course of treatment."
Renal glycosuria,"In most affected individuals, no treatment is required. However, some individuals with renal glycosuria may developdiabetes mellitus. Therefore, appropriate testing should be conducted to rule out diabetes and to regularly monitor those with confirmed renal glycosuria.[1]"
Reticulohistiocytoma,"Reticulohistiocytoma (RH) typically resolve spontaneously over a period of months to years; however, surgical excision usually results in a cure.[4]"
Susac syndrome,"Early, aggressive, and sustained treatment of Susacsyndromeis recommended to avoid or minimize neurological damage,hearing loss, and vision loss. Treatment includes medications that suppress the activity of theimmune system(immunosuppressive therapy) so that it does not attack the blood vessels in the brain, eyes, and ears. Immunosuppressive medications may include high doses ofcorticosteroids,cyclophosphamide,andintravenous immunoglobulins. Doctors may also recommendblood thinnerssuch as aspirin in order to prevent clotting in the small blood vessels.[5]Once treatment has improved symptoms, the medications can be slowly tapered off.[1]Alternative treatments such asmycophenolate mofetilmay be helpful in cases that don’t improve with other treatment. Overall, medications for Susac syndrome can prevent more symptoms from developing and improve symptoms of the condition, but the treatment may not be able to repair neurological, hearing, or visual damage. In some cases, people with severe hearing loss may benefit fromcochlear implants.[4]"
Richter syndrome,"Monoclonal antibodies(MABs) are a type ofbiological therapy. They are man-madeproteinsthat target specific proteins oncancercells. MABs are a fairly new treatment for cancer. Doctors often use the MAB drug calledrituximabalong withchemotherapyandsteroidsto treat Richtersyndrome. Researchers in a trial called the CHOP-OR study are studying whether a new biological therapy similar to rituximab can make CHOP chemotherapy work better. The new biological therapy drug is calledofatumumab (Arzerra). People who have been recently diagnosed with Richter syndrome can participate in this study. The study has two parts. First, patients have ofatumumab with CHOP chemotherapy to eliminate the lymphoma (this is called induction treatment). They then have more ofatumumab on its own to try to stop the lymphoma from coming back (this is called maintenance treatment).CLICK HEREto learn more about this study.Stem cell transplantis another way of treating Richter syndrome. While only a few people have undergone stem cell transplant for treatment of this disease, so far it has appeared to work quite well. The disease was controlled for longer than in people having normal dose chemotherapy. However, because stem cell transplants have serious side effects and complications, they are only suitable for a small group of people. More research is needed before we can truly find out how wellstem celltreatment works for people with Richter syndrome.[3]A recent study showed that a chemotherapy regimen called OFAR (a combination of oxaliplatin, fludarabine, cytarabine, and rituximab) had significant antileukemic activity in patients with Richter syndrome and relapsed/refractory CLL. Patients who underwent stem cell therapy as post-remissiontherapy had even more favorable outcomes.[4]"
Rippling muscle disease,"There is currently no specific treatment for rippling muscle disease (RMD). Management is said to be supportive and based on the symptoms present in each person. In some cases, symptoms overlap with those of othercaveolinopathies. Depending on specific symptoms and severity, management may include:Weight control to avoid obesityPhysical therapyand stretching exercises to promote mobility and preventcontracturesUse of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobilitySocial and emotional support and stimulation to maximize a sense of social involvement and productivity and to reduce the sense of social isolation common in these disorders[1]Only case reports from the 1980s report the benefit ofdantrolene(a muscle relaxant)andcalcium channel antagonistsin two patients.[5]However, we are unaware of any current, well-documented treatment options.For people with immune-mediated RMD associated with myasthenia gravis (an acquired, autoimmune form of RMD),immunosuppressive therapyhas reportedly been effective in improving the symptoms of both conditions. For this reason, it is important to recognize when RMD and myasthenia gravis occur together.[6]"
Rumination disorder,"The main treatment of rumination disorder is behavioral therapy. This may involve habitat reversal strategies, relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing, and biofeedback. These types of therapies can often be administered by agastroenterologist.[2]Other professionals, such as nurse practitioners, psychologists, massage therapists, and recreational therapists may also be involved in care. Ensuring adequate nutrition is essential and treatment will also involve managing other symptoms, such as anxiety, nausea and stomach discomfort (which may involveanti-depressive agents or SSRI’s).[2]If behavioral therapy is unsuccessful, treatment withbaclofenmay be considered. There is limited data regarding optimal treatment of rumination disorder, but success with baclofen has been reported.[2]"
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia(S. maltophilia)bacteriaare usually resistant to manyantibiotics, so options are limited. The recommended therapy istrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole(also called co-trimoxazole, or TMP-SMX).[2]Some patients are unable to tolerate TMP-SMX due to hypersensitivity reaction, drug toxicity, or other adverse reaction.[2]If this medication cannot be used, a variety of other antibiotics may be considered. Combination therapy (using more than one medication) may be necessary in life-threatening cases. However, data regarding the benefit of combination therapy are currently limited so its role remains uncertain.[2]Infections should be treated promptly because delay in appropriate treatment can contribute to significant mortality.[2]The duration of therapy often depends on the site of infection.[1][2]14 days of therapy is typically appropriate for bacteremia (infection in the blood) and 7 days of therapy is appropriate for hospital-acquired pneumonia in people with health immune systems, as long as there is evidence of clinical improvement. Longer durations of therapy (10 to 14 days) are often used in people with compromised immune systems.[2]More detailed information about medications used to treatS. maltophiliainfection is available fromMedscape Reference."
Sacrococcygeal Teratoma,"The treatment for sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) typically involves surgery to remove thetumor. Surgery occurs either in the prenatal period or shortly after delivery. The timing is dependent on the size of the tumor and the associated symptoms.[3]To learn more about both prenatal and postnatal surgery for SCT, visit the following links from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)http://www.chop.edu/treatments/fetal-surgery-sacrococcygeal-teratoma-sct/about#.VqGW_PkrJD8http://www.chop.edu/treatments/postnatal-surgery-sacrococcygeal-teratoma-sct#.VqGX7vkrJD8"
Sarcoidosis,"In many cases of sarcoidosis, no treatment is necessary and the condition will resolve on its own overtime. However, therapies are available to control symptoms, prevent complications and improve outcomes in affected people. A team of medical specialists can help determine which affected people will benefit from these treatments, based on many factors including:[1][5][7][4]The symptoms presentThe severity of the symptomsIf any vitalorgansare affected (lungs, eyes, heart, or brain)How the organ is affectedTreatment options for sarcoidosis generally includecorticosteroidmedications and/or medicines that suppress theimmune system. In people with certain symptoms, antimalarial drugs may be recommended, as well.[1][5][7][4]Prednisoneis the medication most commonly used to treat sarcoidosis. It is in a class of drug called corticosteroids. If the condition worsens when taking prednisone or if the side effects of prednisone are severe, a doctor may prescribe other drugs such asmethotrexate,azathioprine, andcyclophosphamide.[1][5][7][4]"
