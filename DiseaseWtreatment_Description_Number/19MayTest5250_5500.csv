Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Muenke Syndrome,"Children with Muenkesyndromeare best managed by a pediatric craniofacial clinic where a team of health care professionals, including a craniofacial surgeon and neurosurgeon, medicalgeneticist,ophthalmologist,otolaryngologist,pediatrician, radiologist, psychologist, dentist,audiologist,speech therapist, and social worker may work to address their individuals needs. Depending on severity, the firstcraniosynostosisrepair may be performed between ages three and six months. Early surgery may reduce the risk for complications. Follow-up surgeries and/or other medical procedures may be needed.[3]"
Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis,"Dermatologistsandrheumatologistsare often the types of specialists that oversee the treatment of patients with multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. Although no specific therapy has consistently been shown to improve multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, many different drugs have been used.[3]For instance, therapy withnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents(e.g., aspirin or ibuprofen) may help thearthritis.Systemic corticosteroidsand/or cytotoxic agents, particularlycyclophosphamide,chlorambucil, ormethotrexate, may affect the inflammatory response, prevent further joint destruction, and cause skin lesions to regress. Antimalarials (e.g.,hydroxychloroquineandmefloquine)have also been used.Alendronateand other bisphosphonates have been reported to be effective in at least one patient andetanerceptandinfliximabhave been effective in some.[5]"
Multifocal choroiditis,"Multifocal choroiditis (MFC) is generally treated withsteroidmedication that can be taken orally or injected into the affected eye. These treatments may be successful in managing symptoms, though there is no permanent cure for the disease and symptoms may return. If a person no longer responds to steroid treatment, drugs that suppress theimmune system, such ascyclosporine, may be recommended.[1]People with more severe vision loss may also benefit from laser therapy.[2]Frequent monitoring by anophthalmologistis recommended to determine how well treatment is working."
Steatocystoma multiplex,"Treatment options for steatocystoma multiplex are limited and have had varying degrees of success. The most effective treatment method is thought to be removal of cysts by surgery.  However, cosmetic concerns, time, cost, and pain need to be considered because affected individuals often have multiple cysts.[11]In many cases, small incisions (cuts into the skin) allow the cyst and its contents to be removed through the opening.[1]Other treatment options include medications such asoral isotretinointo temporarily shrink the cysts and reduce inflammation ororal antibiotics(tetracycline and derivatives) to reduce redness and swelling. Other procedures may include draining cysts through a procedure calledaspiration,liquid nitrogen cryotherapy,dermabrasion, andcarbon dioxide laser therapy.[1][6][11][12]Laser treatments may be  useful for patients with  numerous cysts in whom removal and drainage is not a realistic choice and for whom other treatments have failed to improve the condition.[11]"
Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy,"Treatment of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) mainly focuses on the specific signs and symptoms present in each individual. Severe drooping of the eyelid (ptosis) may be treated with plastic surgery on the eyelid (blepharoplasty). The goal of this surgery is to raise the eyelid so that the affected individual can see. Individuals with severe difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) may have a surgical procedure known ascricopharyngeal myotomy. In this procedure, the cricopharyngeal muscle of the throat is cut so that when swallowing occurs, the muscle remains relaxed allowing the passage of food or liquid. Orthopedic devices such as canes, leg braces, or walkers can assist individuals who have difficulty walking. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[1][4]"
MYH7-related scapuloperoneal myopathy,There is no standard course of treatment for scapuloperoneal myopathy. Some patients may benefit fromphysical therapyor other therapeutic exercises.[1]
Tubular aggregate myopathy,"Currently, we are unaware of any targeted therapies for tubular aggregate myopathy. There is very limited information in the medical literature regarding the treatment or management of this condition. Supportive therapies may be recommended depending on the severity of symptoms and associated complications. High dose steroids were reported to be effective in one case of myopathy with tubular aggregates in 1991, but the reasons why were unclear.[11]"
X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy,"There are currently no specific treatments for individuals withX-linkedmyopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA). Management is typically symptomatic and supportive, focusing on the specific signs and symptoms present in each individual.For managing myopathies in general,physical therapyand exercise are important for maintaining strength. It is also important to practice good general health measures including a well-balanced nutritional diet, maintenance of normal weight, and proper management of any other chronic illnesses.[3]"
Myotonia congenita,"Treatment for myotonia congenita depends on the symptoms and severity in each person. People with mild symptoms may just need to modify their activities. Those with more severe muscle stiffness might consider or need sodium channel blockers or other medications to relieve symptoms. Medication options may include:Mexiletine- this is a sodium channel blocker and is the best documented treatment option. It may significantly reduce muscle stiffness.Phenytoinorcarbamazepine- these are anticonvulsants that have been reported to help symptoms in some people.Quinine(an antimalarial),dantrolene(a muscle relaxant), oracetazolamide(a diuretic) may help symptoms in some cases.Exercise is known to temporarily relieve myotonia. Some people with myotonia congenita have reported more long-term relief with gymnastics, but this has not been studied in controlled trials. Anesthesia should be used with caution in people with myotonia congenita.[4]"
Myxopapillary ependymoma,"Standard treatment of myxopapillary ependymoma is surgery with the aim of removing as much of thetumoras possible. This tumor type may be cured if all of the tumor is removed during surgery, which is referred to as totalresection, and there is usually a favorable outlook in these cases. However, surgery is typically less curative in tumors that are large, multifocal or extend outside the spinal cord. These tumors have the potential to regrow after the initial diagnosis and surgery (recur), particularly in individuals diagnosed as children.[1]Following surgery,radiation therapymay be considered to destroy anycancercellsthat could remain in the body.  The use ofchemotherapyas another treatment of myxopapillary ependymoma remains controversial; chemotherapy has been widely used in pediatric individuals due to more aggressive disease.[4]The usefulness of additional therapies following surgery is unclear for the subset of individuals with recurrence or in individuals in whom total resection cannot be achieved.[1]"
Naegeli syndrome,"Treatment for Naegelisyndromeis based on an individual's symptoms. Dry skin can be moisturized with creams. Exposure to heat should be limited. To avoid overheating, affected individuals should stay hydrated, wear appropriate clothing, and use wet dressings. Dental care is needed to treat cavities and tooth loss.[1][3]"
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,"Currently, there are no specific therapies for NASH. The most important recommendations given to persons with this disease are to:[1]reduce their weight (if obese or overweight)follow a balanced and healthy dietincrease physical activityavoid alcoholavoid unnecessary medicationsThese are standard recommendations, but they can make a difference. They are also helpful for other conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol.[1]Individuals with other medical conditions (diabetes,high blood pressure, or elevated cholesterol) should be treated with medication as advised by their physician.[1]Some new treatment options are now being studied inclinical trials. These include the use of antioxidants (such asvitamin E,selenium, andbetaine) and some newer antidiabetic medications (metformin,rosiglitazone, andpioglitazone) which treat insulin resistance.[1]"
Necrotizing fasciitis,"Accurate and prompt diagnosis, treatment with intravenous (IV)antibiotics, and surgery to remove deadtissueare vital in treating necrotizing fasciitis. As the blood supply to the infected tissue becomes impaired, antibiotics often cannot penetrate the infected tissue. Therefore, surgery to remove the dead, damaged, or infected tissue is the primary treatment for necrotizing fasciitis.[2][3]Early surgery may minimize tissue loss, eliminating the need for amputation of the infected body part.[4]The choice of antibiotics will likely depend on the particularbacteriainvolved. In addition, supplemental oxygen, fluids, and medicines may be needed to raise the blood pressure.[1]Hyperbaric oxygen therapyandIV immunoglobulinmay also be considered, but their use in patients with necrotizing fasciitis is controversial.[2][1]"
Neonatal progeroid syndrome,"Because neonatal progeroidsyndromeaffects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, afeeding tubemay be recommended in infants with feeding difficulties who have trouble putting on weight.[2]"
Ocular albinism type 1,"Hypersensitivity to light, often called ""photoaversion,"" ""photophobia,"" or ""photodysphoria,"" is the most incapacitating symptom in some people with ocular albinism type 1 (OA1). This symptom may be relieved by sunglasses, transition lenses, or special filter glasses, although many prefer not to wear them because of the reduction in vision from the dark lenses when indoors.Refractive errorsshould be detected and treated as early as possible with appropriate spectacle correction.Abnormal head posturemay be treated with prismatic spectacle correction.Strabismussurgery is usually not necessary but may be performed for cosmetic purposes, particularly if the strabismus or the face turn is marked or fixed.Appropriate education for sun-protective lotions and clothing (preferably by an informed dermatologic consultant) is recommended to moderate the lifelong effects of sun exposure.Children with ocular albinism who are younger than 16 years of age should have an annual ophthalmologic exam (including assessment of refractive error and the need for filter glasses), as well as psychosocial and educational support. Affected adults should have ophthalmologic exams when needed, typically every two to three years.[3]"
Neuroacanthocytosis,"There is currently no cure for neuroacanthocytosis. Management generally focuses on the specific symptoms that are present in each individual and may require the coordination of various specialists. Psychiatric symptoms and chorea may be treated with certain antipsychotic medications known as dopamine-receptor blocking drugs. Other antipsychotic medications as well asantidepressantsand/or sedatives may also be used to treat some affected individuals.Seizuresmay be treated with anti-convulsants, which may also help to treat psychiatric symptoms. Anti-seizure medications that can can worsen involuntary movements are generally avoided.Dystoniahas been treated withbotulinum toxinto relax the muscles and reduce spasms. Because of feeding difficulties in some cases, individuals may need to have their nutrition monitored. Nutritional support, supplementation and/or a feeding tube may be necessary in some cases. Additional therapies that may be used to treat affected individuals may include speech therapy,physical therapyand occupational therapy. Mechanical devices, such as braces or a wheelchair, may benefit some people. Computer-assisted speech devices may be necessary in some cases.[1]More detailed information about treatment for neuroacanthocytosis is available on eMedicine's Web site and can be viewed by clickinghere."
Neurofibromatosis type 1,"The treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. There is currently no way to prevent or stop the growth of thetumorsassociated with NF1.Neurofibromas located on or just below the skin that are disfiguring or irritating may be surgically removed. Malignant (cancerous) peripheral nerve sheath tumors are generally completely removed with surgery (complete surgical excision), although some cases may also requirechemotherapy.Radiation therapyis not recommended because it may increase the risk of the tumors to become malignant. Most optic gliomas associated with NF1 do not cause any symptoms and, therefore, do not require treatment; however, optic gliomas that threaten vision may be treated with surgery and/or chemotherapy. Surgery may also be recommended to correct some of the bone malformations (such asscoliosis) associated with NF1.[1][4]GeneReviewsWeb site offers more specific information for the treatment and management of NF1."
Tarsal tunnel syndrome,"While we do not provide medical advice, the following have been reported as treatment options for tarsal tunnelsyndrome.[2]Individuals should discuss the various treatment options with their personal healthcare provider.Rest and iceOral pain medicationsSteroid injectionsLocal anestheticsPhysical therapyImmobilizationOrthotic devicesDecompression surgery"
Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy,"To date, there is no treatment for the underlying metabolic problem. Current therapies include adhering to strict dietary guidelines and utilizing treatments focused on the associated symptoms. A recent study suggests that people with this condition may benefit from bezafibrate (a medication used to treat high cholesterol) treatment, particularly with respect to lipid accumulation and fat oxidative capacity.[3]Additional studies into this therapy are needed."
Non-involuting congenital hemangioma,"Because non-involutingcongenitalhemangioma (NICH) is quite rare, there are no established guidelines for the treatment of this condition.  However, the authors of one article on NICH suggest that there is no risk for excessive bleeding during the removal of an NICH and it is unlikely to regrow after surgery.[1]Because NICH is abenignskin mark, surgery isn't necessary but can be considered to improve appearance of the skin."
Niemann-Pick disease type A,There is no specific treatment for this disease. Supportive care from the following specialists may be helpful for managing the symptoms:[3][4]Apulmonologistfor respiratory problemsAcardiologistfor heart problemsLiver and spleen specialistsNutritionistsPhysical therapistsAgastroenterologistLearning specialistsYou can learn more about ongoing research efforts to better understand the natural history of this condition and identify treatment options in theResearchsection of our web page.
Noonan-like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome,"If anomalies are found in any system, regularly scheduled follow-up and life-long monitoring may be required. Visit the GeneReviews Web page on Noonansyndrometo read more.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&part=noonan#noonan.ManagementSurgery is usually the treatment of choice for giantcelllesions; however, other options, such as nasal sprays, are being explored.[5]"
Nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis,"Treatment for nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis (NNP) generally aims at controlling and relieving the symptoms that an individual has. Before treatment is initiated, a work-up should be completed to determine whether the condition is secondary to another underlying disorder. If there is an underlying disorder, treatment of this disorder may relieve the symptoms of NNP. In some cases, skin lesions heal spontaneously (remission) but the lesions often later return.[2]There is no treatment method found to be effective for all individuals with NNP. Medications used to treat the condition may includesystemic steroids(such asprednisone) to suppress sudden attacks; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce fever and other signs of malaise; and/or immunosuppressive drugs.[3][4]Relief of symptoms in some affected individuals has also been reported with fibrinolytic agents (medications that help prevent blood clots),hydroxychloroquine,azathioprine,thalidomide,cyclophosphamide,tetracycline,cyclosporin,mycophenolate, andclofazimine.[3][4]More detailed information about the management of nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis is available on theTreatmentandMedicationsections of the Medscape Reference Web site."
Prurigo nodularis,"Prurigo nodularis (PN) can be challenging to treat because people with the disease may respond to treatments differently. Due to the intensity of the itch, people with PN may try several different treatments without receiving much relief.  Some people may try all current treatments available without receiving complete relief. For most people, a combination of several treatments may need to be tried to find out what will work best.The most commonly used treatments for PN are:[1][3][5][6]Corticosteroid creamsthat are applied to the nodules (topical) and covered with special bandages that are air- and water-tightCorticosteroidinjections into the nodulesOintments with menthol or phenol to cool and soothe itchy skinCapsaicin creamOral corticosteroidsOral antihistaminesSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)If these treatments are not effective, other procedures may be used. These includecryotherapy, which uses very cold temperatures to try to reduce the size of the nodules, or laser therapy. Some people have usedphotochemotherapy, which combines the use of a medication that increases the skin’s sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays with special light therapy. In some cases,immunosuppressantshave been used to treat PN. If the lesions become infected,antibioticsor antibiotic ointment may be prescribed.[3]All treatments are typically used in combination withhabit reversal therapy, which aims to reduce the frequency of scratching the skin. This can be helpful in slowing down or stopping the cycle of itching and scratching that is associated with PN. Some people wear gloves while they sleep to reduce scratching.[4]You can read further treatment information by visiting the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology (ACOD)information page on prurigo nodularis.[1]"
Tolosa Hunt syndrome,"Left untreated, symptoms may resolve spontaneously after an average of about eight weeks.Glucocorticoidshave long been the recommended treatment for Tolosa Huntsyndrome. Little consideration has been given to alternative therapies, probably due to the typical rapid response to glucocorticoids (pain usually resolves within 24 to 72 hours after starting treatment). However, there are little data other than case series to determine the most effective dose, the route and schedule of administration, or the length of therapy. Furthermore, while it is known that glucocorticoids relieve the pain associated with the condition, there is no definitive evidence that associated cranial neuropathies recover any faster with or without treatment.[1]A few affected individuals may need other immunosuppressive medications either to limit the complications ofcorticosteroiduse or to keep the disorder inremission. These individuals typically undergo abiopsyto confirm the diagnosis of THS.[1]Close follow-up with repeatMRIis typically recommended to confirm glucocorticoid treatment remains effective and no evidence of another cause for the symptoms develops. Improvement seen on MRI is often not seen until several weeks after signs and symptoms improve.[1]"
Normokalemic periodic paralysis,"Although much progress has been made in understanding periodic paralysis, there is currently no consensus on treatment and effective treatment options are limited.[8]Furthermore, likely because many experts do not consider normokalemic periodic paralysis to be a distinct condition (it is thought to be a variant of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis), there is little information available in the medical literature regarding this specific variant of the rare condition.The limited research that has been published has suggested thatcarbonic acid anhydrase inhibitorsmay reduce attack frequency and severity in periodic paralysis. However, there has not been sufficient information in terms of which of the carbonic acid anhydrase inhibitors (dichlorphenamide oracetazolamide) is more effective or has fewer side effects.[8]Experts generally agree that affected individuals should avoid the triggers of attacks through lifestyle and dietary modification.[9]It has been reported that people with the hyperkalemic form can prevent attacks by eating frequent meals rich in carbohydrates and low in potassium and by avoiding fasting, strenuous activity, and exposure to cold.[6]Symptoms of individuals who are normokalemic during attacks may be improved by exercising.[9]"
Notalgia paresthetica,"While this condition may be difficult to treat, typical neuralgia therapies are often employed with moderate success. Effective measures may include:[3][4]Cooling lotions as required (camphor and menthol)Capsaicincream - this depletes nerve endings of their chemical transmittersLocal anaesthetic creamsAmitriptylinetablets at nightTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(TENS)GabapentinOxcarbazepineBotulinum toxinPhototherapyExerciseAdditional information about treatment of notalgia paresthetica can be accessed byclicking here.You can find relevant journal articles on treatment of notalgia paresthetica through a service called PubMed, a searchable database of medical literature. Information on finding an article and its title, authors, and publishing details is listed here. Some articles are available as a complete document, while information on other studies is available as a summary abstract.

Ocular toxoplasmosis,"In individuals with a normally functioningimmune systemand mild symptoms that do not threaten the function of the eye, treatment may not be needed and symptoms may resolve within 4-8 weeks.[3][2]For cases in which there is a potential for vision loss, treatment may involve the use of anti-parasitic medications,steroids, andantibiotics. Typically, the anti-parasitic medication pyrimethamine is utilized in combination with the antibioticsulfadiazineandcorticosteroids. Other medications that have been used in individuals with ocular toxoplasmosis include the antibioticsclindamycin,azithromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the steroiddexamethasone.[2]"
Oculodentodigital dysplasia,"After a person is diagnosed with oculodentodigital dysplasia, there are a number of steps that can be taken in order to monitor other symptoms that may develop or to improve symptoms that are already occurring. For example, surgery may be recommended to correctsyndactylyof the fingers or to remove bony growths. Possible treatments for conditions of the eye include wearing a patch over an eye that has correctly working muscles in order to strengthen the muscles of the other eye. A medication called oculinum (Botox) may also be injected around the eyes in older patients to correctstrabismus. Your doctor may recommend frequent eye exams to check forglaucomaand vision loss.[2][4]Treatment to correct dental findings may include placing crowns on the teeth. Frequent dental visits to watch for changes are also recommended. Finally, your doctor may also recommend neurological and hearing exams, as these issues are more common in people affected by oculodentodigital dysplasia.[6]"
Potter sequence,"Treatment options associated with Potter sequence depend on the underlying cause of the disease. These options may include akidney transplant, medications to help the lungs develop properly, and surgical treatment of an obstruction blocking the urinary tract. In some cases, surgical treatments may be available for babies during pregnancy.[4]Babies with Potter sequence may require help in order to breathe when they are born. This may includeresuscitationwhen the baby is born andventilationto help maintain normal breathing.[2]If there are problems with the baby’s kidneys,dialysis(removingtoxinsfrom the blood) may be recommended until other treatment becomes available. Some babies with Potter sequence may also requirefeeding tubesto make sure they are getting enough nutrition.[1]"
Spinocerebellar ataxia 2,"Treatment of spinocerebellarataxia2 (SCA2) is supportive and aims to help the affected person maintain their independence and avoid injury. It is recommended that people with SCA2 remain physically active, maintain a healthy weight, use adaptive equipment as needed, and avoid alcohol and medications that affect cerebellar function. Adaptive equipment may include canes or other devices to help with walking and mobility. People with SCA2 may develop difficulty speaking and may need to use computerized devices or writing pads to help with communication. Levodopa may be prescribed to help with some of the movement problems (e.g., rigidity and tremor), and magnesium may improve muscle cramping.[1][3][4]"
Omenn syndrome,"The standard treatment for Omennsyndromeisbone marrow transplantationor cord bloodstem celltransplantation.[1][2]General care for any patient with severe combinedimmunodeficiency(SCID), including Omenn syndrome, includes isolation to prevent infection and meticulous skin and mucosal hygienic practices while the patient is awaiting stemcellreconstitution. Broad-spectrumantibioticsmay be administered parenterally while cultures and body fluid analyses are in progress. Parenteral nutrition may also be provided as therapy for diarrhea and failure to thrive.[1]A detailed description of therapeutic options is provided in the referencedeMedicinearticle."
Renal oncocytoma,"Most renal oncocytomas are benign (non-cancerous) andmetastasisis very rare. Although manybenign tumorsdo not require treatment unless they are causing unpleasant symptoms, it can be difficult to confidently differentiate a renal oncocytoma fromrenal cell carcinomabased ondiagnostic imaging testsalone. Most people are, therefore, treated withsurgerywhich allows for confirmation of the diagnosis. If a renal oncocytoma is strongly suspected prior to surgery, a more conservative procedure such as apartial nephrectomy, may be performed.[4][3]"
Oncogenic osteomalacia,"Treatment for oncogenic osteomalacia is focused on identifying and removing thetumorthat is causing the disease. It is important that all of the tumor is removed to reduce the changes that it will come back again. For most people, removing the tumor cures symptoms of the disease because levels of phosphate and vitamin D are returned to normal. Improvement of symptoms typically occurs within the first weeks or months of surgery.[2]Typically, the tumors associated with oncogenic osteomalacia are notmalignant, meaning that they are unlikely to spread to other parts of the body. Therefore,chemotherapyandradiation therapyare not widely used to treat patients with this disease.[2]After the tumor is removed, it is important that affected individuals continue to receive frequent monitoring to make sure that the tumor does not grow back.[4]This monitoring can take place with frequentimagingand testing levels of FGF23 in the blood.[6]When the tumor cannot be located or cannot be removed surgically, medications are available that can help increase the levels of phosphate and vitamin D in the blood. This is possible by taking phosphate supplements andcalcitriol, which helps increase levels of vitamin D.[4]"
