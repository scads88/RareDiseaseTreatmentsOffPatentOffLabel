Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Abetalipoproteinemia,"Anutritionistor other qualified medical professional should be consulted for specific dietary instruction in people with abetalipoproteinemia. Treatment involves very large doses of vitamin E, as well as large doses of vitamin supplements containing other fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements  are also recommended.[3][2]Several diet changes and/or restrictions are also needed to prevent stomach problems. A low-fat diet may help with digestive symptoms; medium chain triglycerides may be used (under supervision of a specialist) as a source of fat in the diet.[3]Management in adults typically focuses on specific complications associated with the disorder, and depends on the signs and symptoms present. Affected people may need consultations with several other types of specialists, including a lipidologist,gastroenterologist,hepatologist,ophthalmologist, andneurologist.[2]"
Asternia,"Asternia is treated with surgery.  Surgery may be recommended to prevent breathing difficulty and to protect theorgansin the chest, particularly the heart.[1][2][5842]  The type of surgery depends on the size of the gap between the ribs and the age of the affected individual.[2]Ideally, surgery consists of closing the gap by connecting the existing bones of the chest; this is best done while the affected individual is very young.[1][5842]  For older individuals or those with a wide space between the existing bones, surgery may include placing extra material (aprosthesis, made ofcartilageor bone from another part of the body orsynthetic/man-made materials) to fill the gap.[1][2]"
Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,"There is no standard treatment protocol for IBD deficiency. Infants diagnosed throughnewborn screeningare encouraged to work with ametabolic diseasespecialist and a dietician experienced in metabolic disorders. Some treatments may be recommended even if no symptoms have been observed. Treatment may be needed throughout life. The following treatments may be recommended for some babies and children with IBD deficiency.[3]Children with IBD deficiency may be helped by takingL-carnitine, a safe and natural substance which helps the body'scellsmake energy and get rid of harmful wastes. L-carnitine may also help to prevent or treat the heart problems andanemiaseen in children with IBD deficiency.Some infants and children with IBD deficiency may be advised to avoid fasting. Going without food for a long time causes the body to use its stores of fat andproteinfor energy. In some people with IBD deficiency, this may lead to the build up of harmful substances in the blood. Eating frequently (every 4 to 6 hours) may help to avoid these health effects.While most children with IBD deficiency do fine without a change in diet, a low-valine food plan might be necessary. Valine is found in all foods with protein. Foods high in valine, such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dried beans and legumes, nuts and peanut butter should be limited. There are medical foods such low-protein flours, pastas, rice, and special formulas that are made especially for people with organic acid disorders. Your dietician / physician can advise you on whether you should use these foods to supplement your child’s diet."
Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,Treatment of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency usually consists of avoidance of fasting and a low fat diet. Supplemental carnitine may be recommended for some affected children during acute crises. Episodes of acute metabolic acidosis may be treated with intravenous hydration with a solution containing 10% glucose which can reestablish an anabolic state. This can be followed by reintroduction of the patient's usual diet.[2]
Chorea-acanthocytosis,"There are currently no treatments to prevent or slow the progression of chorea-acanthocytosis; treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[2]Management may include:botulinum toxinfor decreasing the oro-facio-lingualdystonia; feeding assistance; speech therapy; mechanical protective devices; splints for foot drop;phenytoin, clobazam, andvalproateforseizuremanagement; antidepressant or antipsychotic medications; dopamine antagonists such as atypical neuroleptics or tetrabenazine; and standard treatment forcardiomyopathy. Surveillance includes monitoring of nutritional status and adaptation of diet to assure adequate caloric intake, cardiac evaluations every five years, andEEGevery third year.[3]"
Acanthoma,"Acanthomas are consideredbenign, but treatment may be done for cosmetic reasons or to relieve any associated symptoms.[2][3]Because acanthomas are quite rare, there are no established guidelines for treatment.  Treatment may depend on the type, number, and location of acanthomas.  For example, a single acanthoma may be removed by surgery, whereas multiple acanthomas may be treated withcryosurgeryor the use of the medicationfluorouracilcream.[2]"
Acanthosis nigricans,"There is no specific treatment for AN. Treatments are used mostly to improve cosmetic appearance and includetopical retinoids,  vitamin D creams (such ascalcipotriol),dermabrasionand laser therapy. Oral retinoid pills have also been used to treat AN, but are not used for most patients because of the multiple side effects and development problems associated with the treatment.
Treatment may also focus on trying to correct the underlying disease that causes AN to develop. Often correcting the underlying disease improves the skin symptoms.  Some steps that can be taken depending on the underlying disease include: correctinghyperinsulinaemiathrough diet and medication, losing weight with obesity-associated AN, removing or treating atumor, or stopping medications that cause AN.[2][3]"
Proud syndrome,"The treatment of Proudsyndromeis based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example,spasticitymay be treated with a variety of therapies including medications and/orphysical therapy.[4]Medications may be prescribed to help prevent and/or control recurrentseizures. Surgery may be required to treat certain physical abnormalities such as kidney or genital issues. Children with severeintellectual disabilitymay benefit from special education services.For personalized information about the treatment and management of Partington syndrome, please speak to a healthcare provider."
Accessory navicular bone,"If the accessory navicular bone is causing symptoms, activities may be restricted and a softer shoe may be recommended until the symptoms go away. If the symptoms persist, a specially and carefully made shoe support may be tried.  For people with accessory navicular bone who experience severe symptoms, surgery may be considered to remove the bony growth. Other treatments may include medications such asnonsteroidal anti-inflammatories(NSAIDs), immobilizing the area with a cast or boot, andphysical therapy.[4]"
Supernumerary nipple,"Most people do not need any treatment for a supernumerary nipple.[2]Removal via surgery or another technique may be considered for cosmetic purposes or if there are symptoms that cause discomfort, such as lactation or tenderness.[3]A thorough work-up for other malformations typically is not needed in a person with a supernumerary nipple who is otherwise healthy. However, a work-up may be recommended if a person has:[1]a supernumerary nipple accompanied by additional minor malformationsa prominent ectopic (abnormally-positioned) supernumerary nipplean establishedfamily historyof supernumerary nipplesPhysical exams andmammographyof ectopic breasttissueshould occur at the frequency recommended for normal breast tissue in any particular person.[1]Supernumerary nipples can undergo similar diseases to normal breast tissue.[3]"
ACDC,"Due to the rarity of this condition, there is very limited information available in the medical literature. We are not aware of specific treatment recommendations for ACDC, or of any therapies currently known to be effective. One affected individual reportedly was treated with surgeries to reroute blood flow through alternate vessels and had a joint amputation in the foot.[3]Several possible future therapies have been proposed.[1]Research is currently under way to investigate possible treatment options.The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through the National Library of Medicine, developedClinicalTrials.govto provide patients, family members, and members of the public with current information on clinical research studies.Click here to find trials relating to ACDC. This site may be checked often for new studies, as it is updated regularly."
Achondroplasia,"Recommendations for management of children with achondroplasia were outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Genetics in the article,Health Supervision for Children with Achondroplasia. We recommend that you review this article with your child’s health care provider(s). These recommendations include:[2]• Monitoring of height, weight, and head circumference using growth curves standardized for achondroplasia• Measures to avoid obesity starting in early childhood.• Careful neurologic examinations, with referral to a pediatricneurologistas necessary•MRIor CT of the foramen magnum region for evaluation of severehypotoniaor signs of spinal cord compression• Obtaining history for possible sleep apnea, with sleep studies as necessary• Evaluation for low thoracic or high lumbar gibbus if truncal weakness is present• Referral to a pediatricorthopedistif bowing of the legs interferes with walking• Management of frequent middle-ear infections• Speech evaluation by age two years• Careful monitoring of social adjustmentThe GeneReview article on achondroplasia also provides information on medical management.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1152/#achondroplasia.Management"
Idiopathic achalasia,"The aim of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter. Therapy may involve:[4][6][5]Injection withbotulinum toxin(Botox) to help relax the sphincter muscles (used as a temporary fix)Medications, such as long-acting nitrates (i.e.isosorbide dinitrate) or calcium channel blockers (i.e.nifedipine), to relax the lower esophagus sphincterSurgery (Heller myotomy) to decrease the pressure in the lower sphincterPneumatic balloon dilation of the esophagus at the location of the narrowing (done duringesophagogastroduodenoscopy)You can learn more about these treatment options by clicking on the following links:eMedicine Esophageal Motility DisordersMerck Manuals Motility DisordersA doctor should help to determine the best treatment for each individual situation.[4]"
