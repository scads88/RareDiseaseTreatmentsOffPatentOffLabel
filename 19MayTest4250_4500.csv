Kikuchi disease,"Kikuchi disease generally goes away (resolves) on its own within one to four months, with or without intervention. However, treatments are available to relieve some of the associated signs and symptoms. For example,nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)may be used to easelymph nodetenderness and fever. The use ofcorticosteroidshas been recommended in severe cases.[1][2]Hydroxychloroquine(an immunosuppressant), alone or in combination with other treatments, has also been successfully used.[4]Since there have been a few case reports ofsystemic lupus erythematosus(SLE or lupus) developing several years after recovery from Kikuchi disease, several medical researchers recommend long term follow-up to check for signs and symptoms of SLE.[2][5]Medscape Reference, a resource for medical professionals, offers more specific information regarding thetreatment and management of Kikuchi disease. You may be asked to register to view the information, but registration is free."
Langerhans cell histiocytosis,"Treatment for Langerhanscellhistiocytosis (LCH) depends upon the individual patient; it may differ depending on the type and severity of the condition as well as what part(s) of the body are affected. In some cases, the disease will go away without any treatment at all. In other cases, depending on the extent of the disease, limited surgery and small doses ofradiation therapyorchemotherapymay be needed. Treatment is planned after complete evaluation of the patient, with the goal of using as little treatment as possible to keep the disease under control.[1]No consensus exists for the best therapy for LCH, especially when multipleorgansare involved. However, the Histiocyte Society has done manyclinical trialsto evaluate the effect of several treatments, which have resulted inrecommendations by the Histiocyte Society.Generally, the choice of treatment is based on disease severity. The International LCH Study of the Histiocyte Society proposes classifying LCH cases by the number of systems involved and by the number of sites within that system (e.g., involving one or more bones, involving one or multiplelymph nodes). Although most of the trials are in children, the recommendations can also be used for adults.[5]Detailed information about the treatment of LCH can be viewed on Medscape Reference's Web site."
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,"Once the diagnosis of HLHS is made, the baby will likely be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).[6]Management options should be clearly explained to parents and families to allow them to make the best possible informed decision. Choices for management may include staged surgeries, heart transplantation, and comfort care measures (with no surgical interventions). Most pediatriccardiologistsand surgeons in the US recommend staged surgery, and there is debate among experts about whether comfort care should be offered as an option at all. Improvements in medical and surgical care have improved outcomes for children with HLHS significantly.[3]However, babies that are treated with surgery are not guaranteed to survive. While some doctors consider heart transplantation an alternative to the 3 step surgery, there are few donated hearts available for small infants.[6]Initial management focuses on helping the baby breathe and keeping the ductus arteriosis open so blood circulates through the body (with prostaglandin E1). These measures stabilize the baby until the first surgery is performed.[6][3]Staged surgery consists of 3 procedures: one in the neonate, one at 3 to 6 months of age, and one at 18 to 30 months of age.[3]The choice of the specific procedure for each stage may vary depending on the baby's individual circumstances. Some people may need more surgeries later on if they develop complications from the condition or from prior surgeries.[6]"
Homocystinuria due to MTHFR deficiency,"Treatment of MTHFR deficiency involves taking betaine, folinic acid, Vitamins B6 and B12, methionine, and methyltetrahydrofolate supplements.[2][4]If MTHFR deficiency is diagnosed early and betaine treatment is started right away, affected infants have a much better developmental outcome.[2]Treatments started later do not reverse symptoms but can cause favorable improvements in symptoms.[2]"
X-linked hypophosphatemia,"XLH is different from other types of rickets because it cannot be treated by increasingvitamin Dalone.[1]Phosphate supplements are generally required and are typically combined with high dosecalcitriol. Calcitriol increases calcium levels by increasing the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestines and the amount of calcium kept in the kidneys.[5]In children, treatment is usually started at the time of diagnosis and continues until bones stop growing.[3]The main treatment goal for adults is to help improve pain. Other treatments for XLH, depending on symptoms and severity, may include:[3][5][9]Growthhormoneto improve growth in children.Corrective surgery to fix bowed or bent legs.Treatment to repair skull abnormalities, such as premature fusion of the skull bones (synostosis).Dental procedures to treat pain in the teeth and gums."
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1,"No cure or treatment exists for human T-cellleukemiavirus, type 1 (HTLV-1). Management is focused on early detection and preventing the spread of HTLV-1 to others.Screeningblood doners, promoting safe sex and discouraging needle sharing can decrease the number of new infections. Mother-to-child transmission can be reduced by screening pregnant women so infected mothers can avoid breastfeeding.[4][2]"
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 2,"No cure or treatment exists for human T-cellleukemiavirus, type 2 (HTLV-2). Management is focused on early detection and preventing the spread of HTLV-2 to others.Screeningblood doners, promoting safe sex and discouraging needle sharing can decrease the number of new infections. Mother-to-child transmission can be reduced by screening pregnant women so infected mothers can avoid breastfeeding.[2][1]"
Juvenile Huntington disease,"Currently there is no cure for juvenile HD, and there is no way to slow or stop the progression of the disease. Treatment therefore aims to relieve symptoms and increase quality of life. A number of medications are available  to help control or ease muscle stiffness,dystonia, and chorea. Physical and occupational therapy may also be helpful for temporarily easing these symptoms, developing strategies for moving around, and preventing falls. Medications are also available to help withseizures, as well as behavioral or psychiatric problems such as attention deficit or depression. Unfortunately, there are no medications known to improve thinking ability (cognitive function) in people with HD.The family of a child with juvenile HD should meet with school representatives to develop anIndividual Education Plan(IEP), which should be reviewed frequently as the disease progresses."
Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome,It has been suggested thatphysical therapymay help to treat jointcontracturesin juvenile hyaline fibromatosis; this therapy should be done with an awareness of the pain tolerance of each affected individual.Splintingmay help reduce pain associated with contractures by stabilizing the joint.[3]
Lipoid proteinosis of Urbach and Wiethe,"There is currently no cure for lipoid proteinosis (LP) of Urbach and Wiethe. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. The skin abnormalities found in people affected by LP may be treated with certain medications, includingcorticosteriods, dimethyl sulfoxide; ord-penicillamine. An additional medication calledacitretincan be used to treat hoarseness and some skin problems.Anticonvulsantmedications are often prescribed for people withseizures. The success of these medications in treating the signs and symptoms of LP varies.[1][2][3]Affected people with growths on their vocal cords or eyelids may be treated withcarbon dioxide laser surgery. Dermabrasion (removal of the top layer of skin) may also improve the appearance of skin abnormalities.[1][2]"
Hydranencephaly,"Unfortunately, there is no definitive treatment for hydranencephaly. Management of the condition typically focuses on the specific signs and symptoms present in the affected individual and is mostly supportive.Hydrocephalus(the buildup of too much cerebral spinal fluid in the brain) may be treated with a shunt (a surgically implanted tube that helps to drain fluid from the brain).[1][2]"
Ochoa syndrome,"Treatment for Ochoasyndromefocuses on the specific symptoms that are present in each individual. Management may require the coordinated efforts of a team of specialists, which may includepediatricians,urologists,nephrologists, surgeons,dietitians, and/or other health care professionals.[5]Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent upper urinary tract deterioration andrenal failure.[6]In many cases, therapy for urinary tract infections includesantibioticsfor the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections and pain relievers.[5]Treatment may also involve bladder re-education,anticholinergic therapyandalpha-blockers.[6]In some cases, surgery may be needed to correct urinary tract obstruction and reconstruct certain portions of the urinary tract.[5]Intermittent catheterization may also be needed.[6]In affected children who experience chronic renal failure,dialysis(hemodialysisand/orperitoneal dialysis) may be necessary.Kidney transplantationmay be considered for individuals with severe renal failure.[5]"
