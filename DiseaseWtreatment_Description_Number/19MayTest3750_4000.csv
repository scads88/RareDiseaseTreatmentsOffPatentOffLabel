Hemifacial microsomia,"Treatment of hemifacial microsomia varies depending on the features present and the severity in each affected person. Various types of surgeries may be needed in many cases.Some children need breathing support or atracheostomysoon after birth if the jaw is severely affected. However in most cases, airway problems can be managed without surgery. Those with a jaw deformity and/or clefts may have feeding problems and may need supplemental feedings through anasogastric tubeto support growth and weight gain. Babies born withcleft lip or palatecan have surgical repairs done during the first year.Cleft liprepair is typically performed when the child is 3-6 months old, whilecleft palatesurgery is generally performed when the child is about a year old. A lateral facial cleft, one of the most severe abnormalities associated with the condition, also requires reconstruction in stages.If eye closure is incomplete due to eyelid abnormalities or facial paralysis is present, a child may need eye protection or surgery. Surgery may also be used for eyelid differences to reposition the lower lids and corners of the eyes. Some children with abnormally shaped or missing ears may choose to have a series of reconstructive surgeries to make the ear appear more normal. Children with skin, cheek and other softtissuedeficiencies may need augmentation procedures such as fat grafting or tissue transfer. Severe bone abnormalities may require surgery as well.[14]Because multiple body systems may be involved in hemifacial microsomia, affected people should continually be monitored for complications."
Trimethylaminuria,"Although there is no cure for trimethylaminuria, the following are some ways to reduce symptoms of odor:[1][3]Avoidance of foods that contain trimethylamine and its precursors (choline, lecithin, and trimethylamine N-oxide). Trimethylamine is present in high levels in milk obtained from wheat-fed cows. Choline is present in high amounts in: eggs, liver, kidney, peas, beans, peanuts, soy products, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower. Trimethylamine N-oxide is present in seafoodLow doses ofantibiotics. This decreases the amount of trimethylamine that is made bybacteriain the intestinesLaxativescan decrease the amount of time food remains in the intestines and therefore reduce the amount of trimethylamine madeNutritional supplements (activated charcoal and copper chlorophyllin) can decrease the concentration of trimethylamine in the urineSoaps with a moderatepH(between 5.5 and 6.5) can help remove the secreted trimethylamine from the skinRiboflavin (vitamin B2) supplements can enhance any existing FMO3enzymeactivity (which breaks down trimethylamine)Avoidance of exercise, stress, emotional upsets, and other factors that can promote sweatingPeople with trimethylaminuria may also find the following to be helpful:[1]Behavioral counseling to help with depression and other psychological symptomsGenetic counselingto better understand how they developed trimethylaminuria and the risks of passing the condition on to their childrenNOTE: People should follow the treatment advice of their healthcare provider and should not attempt to self-administer these treatment approaches. Medications and supplements can have unintended interactions, and dietary restrictions can result in nutritional deficits."
Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome,"Fitz-Hugh-Curtissyndrome(FHCS) is treated withantibiotics, given byintravenous(IV) injection or as medication taken by mouth.  The specific antibiotic medication is determined by the type of underlying infection; that is, treatment depends on whether the infection ischlamydiaorgonorrhea.  If pain continues after treatment with antibiotics, surgery (laparoscopy) may be done to remove bands oftissue(adhesions) that connect the liver to the abdominal wall and cause pain in individuals with FHCS.[1][2]"
Florid cemento-osseous dysplasia,"In many cases florid cemento-osseous dysplasia does not require treatment, however careful follow-up may be warranted.[2]When the condition causes discomfort, pain, or disfigurement, the treatment plan is tailored to the patient. The following article describes the treatment of florid cemento-osseous dysplasia in one patient. We recommend that you speak with your dentist to learn more about your treatment options and for referrals to local specialists.Minhas G, Hodge T, Gill DS.Orthodontic treatment and cemento-osseous dysplasia: a case report.J Orthod. 2008 Jun;35(2):90-5.You can also use the following tools to help you find specialists in your area.The Academy of General Dentistry has a tool for finding member dentists in your area.http://www.knowyourteeth.com/findadentist/The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons offers the following tool for findingmember oral and maxillofacial surgeons in your area.http://www.aaoms.org/findoms.phpSometimes with more rare diseases, it can be helpful to have an evaluation with a specialist at a major university hospital or academic medical center. Such facilities often have access to up-to-date testing and technology, a large group of health care providers and specialists to consult with, and research opportunities."
Lichen planopilaris,"There is not yet a cure for lichen planopilaris. Treatment depends on how much of the scalp is affected and how quickly the condition progresses.[6]A high or moderate potencysteroidcream is often effective in treating lichen planopilaris. If this is not effective, steroid injections (into
skin lesions), or systemiccorticosteroids(taken by mouth) may be considered.Hydroxychloroquine(Plaquenil),retinoids(Accutane), oralcyclosporine,methotrexate,mycophenolate mofetil,rituximab, andpioglitazonehave also been used to treat lichen planopilaris with
some success, although information on these treatments is limited.[3][6][7][8][9]Unfortunately even with successful treatment, lichen planopilaris can return."
Fowler's syndrome,"The urinary incontinence caused by Fowler’ssyndromemay be treated by sacral neuromodulation therapy.[1]The success rate for treatment of Fowler’s syndrome with neuromodulation has been estimated to be around 70%, even in women who have been experiencing symptoms for a while.[3]Neuromodulation therapy involves the stimulation of nerves to the bladder leaving the spine. The FDA has approved a device called InterStim for this purpose. Your doctor will need to test to determine if this device would be helpful to you. The doctor applies an external stimulator to determine if neuromodulation works in you. If you have a 50 percent reduction in symptoms, a surgeon will implant the device. Although neuromodulation can be effective, it is not for everyone. The therapy is expensive, involving surgery with possible surgical revisions and replacement.[3]Other treatments that have been tried with little success include hormonal manipulation, pharmacologic therapy, and injections of botulinumtoxin.[1]"
Fragile X syndrome,"There is no specific treatment available for fragile Xsyndrome.  Management of this condition is generally supportive and may include:recognizing the need for special education and avoiding excessive stimulation, which may help with behavioral problemsearly educational intervention and special education that is tailored to specific learning difficulties; small class size, individual attention and avoidance of sudden change is often neededmedications for behavioral issues that affect social interactionroutine medical management ofstrabismus, ear infections, reflux,seizures,mitral valve prolapse, and/orhigh blood pressure.[3]"
Hallermann-Streiff syndrome,"Treatment for Hallermann-Streiffsyndromedepends on the specific signs and symptoms present in each affected individual. Early disease management for infants may include monitoring of breathing, consideration oftracheostomy, and various measures to improve feeding and ensure sufficient intake of nutrients. Although early surgical removal ofcataractsmay be recommended to help preserve vision, some studies have suggested that spontaneous cataract absorption may occur in up to 50% of untreated patients. Regular appointments with anophthalmologistare strongly recommended to identify and treat other eye abnormalities, some of which may require surgical intervention.With respect to dental anomalies, natal/neonatal teeth (teeth present at birth) may be incorrectly diagnosed as extra teeth and there may be a tendency to extract them. However, the loss of teeth may worsen glossoptosis (posteriorly location of the tongue) or cause other complications. It has thus been recommended to preserve prematurely erupting teeth to facilitate eating until the existence of successional permanent teeth can be confirmed. Ensuring good dental hygiene is also important.Management of the condition may also include surgical reconstruction of certain craniofacial malformations (particularly the mandibular and nasal region) at the appropriate age. For some affected infants and children with heart defects, medical treatment and/or surgical intervention may be recommended.[3]"
Gamma heavy chain disease,"People with symptoms may respond tochemotherapydrugs,corticosteroids, andradiation therapy.[2][3]Commonly used chemotherapeutic agents include cyclophosphamide,prednisone, vincristine, chlorambucil and doxorubicin. Patients are most commonly treated and followed byoncologistsand/orhematologists.[1]Additional information about treatment of gamma heavy chain disease can be found through PubMed, a searchable database of biomedical journal articles. Although not all of the articles are available for free online, most articles listed in PubMed have a summary available. To obtain the full article, contact a medical/university library or your local library for interlibrary loan. You can also order articles online through the publisher's Web site.

Freiberg's disease,"The treatment of Freiberg's disease depends on many factors, including the severity of condition; the signs and symptoms present; and the age of the patient. The primary goal of therapy is to rest the joint and reduce pain and swelling. A more conservative treatment approach is typically attempted initially which may include modification of activities with different types of casts, crutches and/or shoe inserts, as needed. Medications such asnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)may be recommended to manage pain.[1][2][3]If other treatments are not effective, surgery may be necessary.Medscape Reference'sWeb site offers more specific information regarding the different surgical procedures used to treat Freiberg's disease. Please click on the link to access the resource."
Frontometaphyseal dysplasia,"Treatment depends on the symptoms present in the person, and may include:[1][2]Hearing lossaids for deafnessSurgery to correct the facial deformities including the frontal deformitySurgery to correct the jointcontractures, the limb bowing, and thescoliosis."
Hemochromatosis type 5,"The treatment options for hemochromatosis type 5 may depend on the signs or symptoms that each person has. The family with this disease that has been reported in the medical literature did not have symptoms of the disease. For people who do not have symptoms of hemochromatosis type 5, treatment may not be necessary. Doctors may wish to monitor these people withblood teststo make sure iron levels do not become too high. This management is used for people who have other types of asymptomatic hemochromatosis.[5]If a person with hemochromatosis type 5 has symptoms of the disease, a doctor may recommend treatments that are used in other types of symptomatic hemochromatosis. Treatment options may include reducing iron levels by removing blood (phlebotomy),iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications of the disease.[5]Dietary recommendations for people with hemochromatosis may include avoiding alcohol and red meat. People with hemochromatosis are not recommended to take iron or vitamin C supplements.[6]For more detailed information regarding the treatment of hemochromatosis, please reference theMedscape article about hemochromatosis.You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free."
Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers,"While there is no cure for MERRF, there are various medications and therapies that can be helpful in managing symptoms. This includes: Antiseizure medications,levetiracetamfor myoclonus,physical therapy, and aerobic exercise. Standard medication is used to treat cardiac symptoms.Daily use ofCoenzyme Q10andL-carnitinehave been of some benefit to individuals. Other supplements that might be utilized include creatinine and lipoic acid.[1]"
Fumarase deficiency,"Currently there is no effective treatment for fumarase deficiency. The goal of management is to improve symptoms, prevent complications, and increase quality of life. Examples of management options include:[3]Standard anticonvulsant medications forseizures.Placement of afeeding tube(if needed) for optimal nutrition and to prevent aspiration.Special needs services for support with motor, language, and social development."
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,"The most important aspect of management for G6PD deficiency is to avoid agents that might trigger an attack. In cases of acutehemolytic anemia, ablood transfusionor even anexchange transfusionmay be required.[5]The G6PD Deficiency Association, which is an advocacy group that provides information and supportive resources to individuals and families affected by G6PD deficiency, provides alist of drugs and food ingredientsthat individuals with this condition should avoid. They also maintain alist of low risk drugsthat are generally safe to take in low doses."
Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency,"Treatment of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADH) is generally symptomatic and typically focuses on the treatment ofseizuresand neurobehavioral disturbances. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that have proven to be effective in treating the seizures associated with this condition includecarbamazepineandlamotrigine(LTG). Medications such asmethylphenidate,thioridazine,risperidal,fluoxetine, andbenzodiazepinesappear to be effective at treating anxiety, aggressiveness, inattention, and hallucinations. Additional treatments may include physical and occupational therapy, sensory integration, and/or speech therapy.[3]"
Krabbe disease,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for Krabbe disease. However, preliminary studies suggest hematopoieticstem celltransplantation (i.e. umbilical cord blood stemcells) may be an effective treatment in affected babies who have not yet developed symptoms and in older people with mild symptoms. For example, there is evidence that this treatment may delay disease progression and improve survival and quality of life. Although both short-term and long-term benefits have been reported, the data comes primarily from smallclinical trials; thus, additional research is needed to more clearly define the outcomes of this treatment.[5][1][3]When a diagnosis is made after a person has already developed symptoms, treatment is focused on the symptoms present and may include various medications, adaptive equipment and therapies - includingphysical, respiratory,occupational, and speech.[5][1]The advocacy organization,Hunter's Hope, offers a family resource guide that includes information on the supportive treatment of Krabbe disease as well as tips for caring for an affected child.

Galactosemia,"When treatment starts before a baby is 10 days old, there is a much better chance for normal growth, development and intelligence.[1]Affected individuals must avoid all milk, milk-containing products (including dry milk), and other foods that contain galactose for life. It is essential to read product labels and be an informed consumer. Infants can be fed with soy formula, meat-based formula or Nutramigen (aproteinhydrolysate formula), or another lactose-free formula. Calcium supplements are also recommended.[2]Because the body also makes some galactose, symptoms cannot be completely avoided by removing all lactose and galactose from the diet.  Researchers are working on finding a treatment to lower the amount of galactose made by the body, but there is no effective method to do so at this time.[1]TheScreening, Technology, and Research in Genetics (STAR-G) Project is a US-based organization that provides information onnewborn screening. They provide comprehensive information for treatment on galactosemia. To view this information,click here."
Gardner syndrome,"Although there is no cure for Gardnersyndrome, treatment and management options are available to reduce the risk ofcancer. For example, affected people typically undergo regularscreeningfor the various polyps andtumorsassociated with Gardner syndrome to permit early diagnosis and treatment. This screening regimen may include:[6][3]Sigmoidoscopyorcolonoscopyevery one to two years, beginning at age ten to 12 years. Once polyps are detected, colonoscopy is recommended annually until colectomy (removal of colon).EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)beginning by age 25 and repeated every one to three years.Annualphysical examination, including a thorough thyroid evaluation beginning in the late teenage years.Screening fordesmoid tumorsand hepatoblastoma (a specific type of liver cancer that is diagnosed in young children) may also be recommended in some people.A colectomy is usually recommended when more than 20 or 30 polyps and/or multiple advanced polyps are identified.Sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), is sometimes prescribed in people with Gardner syndrome who have had a colectomy to treat polyps in the remaining rectum.[3][7]Treatment for desmoid tumors varies depending on the size and location of the tumor, but may includewatchful waiting, surgery, NSAIDS, anti-estrogenmedications,chemotherapyand/orradiation therapy.[3][7]Osteomas (bony growths) may be removed for cosmetic reasons.[3]Treatment of epidermoid cysts in Gardner syndrome is similar to that used for ordinary cysts and involvesexcision.[5]"
Watermelon stomach,"Watermelon stomach is usually treated with endoscopic laser surgery or argon plasma coagulation. Both of these procedures are performed byendoscopy. Endoscopic laser surgery uses a laser light to treat bleeding blood vessels, while argon plasma coagulation uses argon gas and electrical current to seal irregular or bleedingtissue.[1][2]In some cases, people may be treated with certain medications that help stop or control thegastrointestinal bleeding.Corticosteriods,tranexamic acid, andhormone therapy(withestrogenandprogesterone) have been used to treat watermelon stomach with some success.[2]Depending on the severity of the bleeding,blood transfusionsmay also be necessary at the time of diagnosis. Additional transfusions may be recommended if gastrointestinal bleeding can not be stopped or controlled.[2]"
Menetrier disease,"No one treatment has proven effective for all patients with Ménétrier disease. In milder cases, treatment may be supportive with a recommended highproteindiet to offset loss of protein. Other treatment options for moderate or more severe cases may include: Treatment of underlyingCMV/Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori)infection; medications such as Gastric antisecretory agents (protein pump inhibitors),octreotide, andcetuximab; and agastrectomy.[3]"
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors,"For patients with primary, localized gastrointestinal stromaltumors(GIST), surgery with complete excision is often the first line of treatment. However, surgery may not be as successful in the treatment of recurrent and metastatic GIST.[2][4]The TKI imatinib mesylate (imatinib) may be used as the first treatment option  for tumors which cannot be removed completely by surgery (unresectable), cancerous GIST that has spread (metastatic), or recurrent GIST.  TKI sunitinib malate (sunitinab) is generally given to people if treatment with imatinib has not been successful.KITandPDGFRAgenetic testingmay  help predicting tumor responses to kinase inhibitors.[2][4]"
