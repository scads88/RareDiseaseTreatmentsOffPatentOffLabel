Alopecia universalis,"No therapy has been found to work for everyone who has alopecia universalis (AU) which makes managing AU challenging. Although multiple treatments have been explored, no therapy is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some promising therapies include:[6]diphenylcyclopropenone(DPCP)squaric acid dibutylester (SADBE)photodynamic therapysteroidscyclosporinein combination with methylprednisolone (a steroid)There are several recent studies showing that a class of medication known as JAK inhibitors, which includesTofacitinibandRuxolitinib, are effective in alopecia areata, including AU. However, JAK inhibitors have not yet been approved by the FDA for use in skin conditions.[7][8]In some people with AU, hair regrowth occurs without treatment, sometimes after many years.[9]There are steps that can be taken to decrease the chance of getting too much sun and minimize other  discomforts related to having no hair. These may include:[2]Using sunscreen on the scalp, face, and all areas of the skin exposed to the sunWearing eyeglasses or sunglasses to protect the eyes from too much sun and from dust and debris when eyebrows or eyelashes are missingWearing wigs, caps, or scarves to protect the scalp from the sun and keep the head warmApplying an ointment inside the nostrils to keep them moisturized and help to protect against organisms invading the nose when nostril hair is missingMany other treatments have been reported to have variable response rates in small studies in alopecia areata. These include latanoprost,  nitrogen mustard, massage and relaxation, isoprinosine, acupuncture, and aromatherapy, among others.[8]"
Alpers syndrome,"Treatment for Alperssyndromeis limited to managment of symptoms and supportive care. There is currently no cure.[2][3]A multi-disciplinary medical team of agastroenterologist,neurologist, occupational, physical and/orspeech therapistcan assist with management of symptoms to maintain function as long as possible, insure comfort and promote the best possible quality-of-life.[2]"
Myofibrillar myopathy,"The treatment of myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person. People who have progressive muscles weakness may requirephysical therapyand assistive devices such as a cane or wheelchair. Individuals who havecardiomyopathyorarrhythmiamay require apacemakerorimplantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). In severe cases, people with MFM may have progressive heart disease that requires aheart transplant.[1]Surveillance of the heart, lungs, and muscles are recommended every year or as determined by a doctor.For some affected individuals, the progressive muscle weakness may affect the ability of the muscles of the lungs to work properly, especially at night. This may require respiratory support such as aventilatorto make sure affected individuals are breathing properly.[1]"
Alpha-mannosidosis,"Treatments to address individual symptoms are recommended as needed, such as vaccinations,antibiotics, hearing aids, glasses, orthopedic and other assistive devices, educational interventions, and speech therapy. Regular follow-up to monitor health and treatment response is advised.[2]Current treatment options for alpha mannosidosis may includebone marrow transplant or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.Enzymereplacement therapy may be an additional treatment option in the future.[2][3]"
Alpha-thalassemia,Treatment of alpha-thalassemia often includesblood transfusionsto provide healthy bloodcellsthat have normal hemoglobin.Bone marrow transplanthas helped to cure a small number of individuals with severe alpha-thalassemia.[4]
