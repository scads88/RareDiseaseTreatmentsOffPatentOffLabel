Acute myeloid leukemia with abnormal bone marrow eosinophils inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22),"Acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML) is typically treated withchemotherapy, drugs injected into the bloodstream that target and destroycancercells.  The amount and type of chemotherapy used to treat AMML depends on the age and health of the affected individual.  The first step of chemotherapy for AMML isinduction therapy, treatment with drugs that aim to destroy the cancer cells in the bone marrow and blood.  Induction thearpy is followed by a rest phase to allow the affected individual to recover from the initial treatments.  Then, the second step of chemotherapy is given, calledconsolidation therapy, which should destroy any cancer cells that may remain in the body.[1]Stem cell transplantor participation in aclinical trialmay also be used to treat AMML if chemotherapy treatments are unsuccessful.[2]"
Rheumatic Fever,"Treatment of rheumatic fever usually consists ofantibioticsto treat the underlying group AStreptococcusbacterial infection and anti-inflammatory medications such asaspirinorcorticosteroids. Because people with a history of rheumatic fever have a high risk of developing recurrent episodes of the condition, low dose antibiotics are often continued over a long period of time to prevent recurrence.[1][2][3][6]"
Canavan disease,"Canavan disease causes progressive brain atrophy. There is no cure, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[2][3]Management may include provision of adequate nutrition and hydration, treatment ofinfectious diseases, and protection of the airway.Physical therapymay help to minimizecontracturesand maximize motor abilities and seating posture. Special education programs can enhance communication skills.Seizuresare treated with anti-epileptic drugs.Gastrostomycan help to maintain adequate food intake and hydration when swallowing difficulties exist.[4]"
"Early-onset, autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease","Unfortunately, there is no cure for Alzheimer disease in general; however, there are medications that may assist in temporarily helping with memory and thinking problems, such asExelon,Galantamine, andAricept. Physical and occupational therapy can be helpful in managing problems with walking and activities of daily living. Depression andseizuresmay be treated with appropriate medications.[1]"
Adenosine deaminase deficiency,"The treatment of adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) usually consists of the following:[2]Early diagnosis and therapy for bacterial, viral, and fungal infectionsProphylacticmedications for certain types of pneumoniaIntravenous (IV) immunoglobulinto boost the body's natural response to infectionsIt is also important to restore the function of theimmune system, if possible. The most effective treatment is transplantation of blood-formingstem cellsfrom thebone marrowof a healthy person (calledbone marrow transplant/stem cell transplantor BMT/SCT). This therapy cures the condition in approximately 70% or more of people with severe combinedimmunodeficiency(SCID), including those affected by ADA. If a BMT/SCT is not an option,enzymereplacement therapy (ERT) may be recommended. ERT is a treatment that replaces the enzyme that is missing or not working properly (adenosine deaminase) with a synthetic form of the enzyme.[2][5][6]For more information about the treatment and management of ADA, pleaseclick here."
Craniopharyngioma,"Essentially, two main management options are available for craniopharyngiomas: (1) attempt at gross total resection or (2) partial surgery followed by radiotherapy.No firm consensus of opinion exists concerning the appropriate management of craniopharyngiomas, and no guidelines have as yet been established.Treatment may include a combination of the following: surgery to remove the full or partialtumor(resection),radiation therapy, cyst drainage,chemotherapy, andbiologic therapy.[2]Systemic biologic therapies currently under investigation with promising results includeinterferon(IFN) alpha-2a for progressive or recurrent craniopharyngiomas.[4]An experienced multidisciplinary team of different specialists (neurosurgeon,radiation oncologist, neuro-oncologist,endocrinologist,ophthalmologist) is essential for the best treatment of both pediatric and adult patients with craniopharyngiomas.[6]"
Spinocerebellar ataxia 7,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for spinocerebellarataxia7 (SCA7). Management of affected individuals is generally supportive because there is currently no known treatment to delay or stop the progression of the disease. Exercise and/orphysical therapyhas not been shown to help with incoordination or muscle weakness, but individuals with SCA7 should try to maintain active. Canes and walkers can help prevent falls. Modification of the home with conveniences such as grab bars, raised toilet seats, and ramps to accommodate motorized chairs may be necessary. Speech therapy and communication devices such as writing pads and computer-based devices may benefit those withdysarthria(difficulty speaking). Weighted eating utensils and dressing hooks can help maintain a sense of independence. Whendysphagia(difficulty swallowing) becomes troublesome, video esophagrams (a study using videox-raysof the esophagus) can identify the consistency of food least likely to trigger aspiration.[2]"
Sialadenitis,"The treatment of sialadenitis depends on what type of microbe is causing the infection. If the infection is bacterial, anantibioticeffective against whicheverbacteriais present will be the treatment of choice. If the infection is due to avirus, such as herpes, treatment is usually symptomatic but may include antiviral medications.[1][2][3][4]In addition, since sialadenitis usually occurs after decreased flow of saliva (hyposecretion), patients are usually advised to drink plenty of fluids and eat or drink things that trigger saliva flow (such as lemon juice or hard candy). Warm compresses, and gland massage may also be helpful if the flow is obstructed in some way. Good oral hygiene are also important. Occasionally an abscess may form which needs to be drained especially if it proves resistant to antibiotics (or antiviral medication)[1][2][3][4]In rare cases of chronic or relapsing sialadenitis, surgery may be needed to remove part or all of the gland. This is more common when there is an underlying condition which is causing the hyposecretion.[1]"
Ameloblastoma,"The preferred treatment for ameloblastoma is surgical removal of the affectedtissue. In an effort to prevent recurrence, a wide margin of healthy tissue should be removed from the area surrounding thetumor. If the tumor does return, surgery can be performed again.[2]Ameloblastoma rarely becomes malignant. If malignant spread of the tumor occurs, radiation may be recommended. Malignancy is more common in cases that reoccur after surgery.[2]Singh et al. have developed aTreatment Algorithm for Ameloblastoma, which you may find of interest."
Adenoma of the adrenal gland,"The best treatment options for adenomas of the adrenal gland depend on many factors, including whether or not the adenoma is ""functional"" (releasinghormones). People with adrenal adenomas that are not releasing hormones usually do not require any immediate treatment; however, they may need to follow up with a healthcare provider regularly to determine if the adenoma has grown and to make sure that it does not start producing hormones.[7]Functional adrenal adenomas are typically treated with surgery. Removal of the affected adrenal gland usually resolves other medical conditions that may be present as a result of elevated adrenal hormones (i.e.primary aldosteronism,Cushing's syndrome). In some cases, functional adrenal adenomas can be treated with medications that block the function or lower the levels of the overproduced hormone.[4][6][5][7]"
Adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 deficiency,"Although there is no cure for AMP1 deficiency, there may be ways to manage symptoms. One possibility  is the use of a sugar called D-ribose.[2][3][4]This sugar is easily absorbed in digestive system and rapidly cleared by metabolic pathways. It may provide an additional source of energy for muscle' however, the helpful effects of D-ribose are short-term.[3][4]"
Adenylosuccinase deficiency,"At the current time, there are no effective therapies for the treatment of adenylosuccinase deficiency. Treatment is supportive based on the specific features.[1]"
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,"Management is usually best accomplished by a team of physicians and other healthcare professionals. The team may include anutritionist, a pediatric (or adult)nephrologistorendocrinologist, and a clinicalgeneticist.[4]The basis of management involves free access to drinking water and toilet facilities. The polyuria can be lowered with a low-salt (sodium), low-proteindiet; thiazide diuretics:hydrochlorothiazideandchlorothiazide; other diuretics (i.e., potassium-sparing diureticamiloride); and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such asindomethacin. In babies, early recognition is very important because treatment can avoid the physical andintellectual disabilitythat results from repeated episodes of dehydration and high levels of sodium (hypernatremia). Infants and very young children should be offered water every two hours during the day and night. In severe cases, continuous gastric feeding may be required. In adults, the decision to treat is based upon the individual patient's intolerance of the polyuria and polydipsia since, in almost all patients, the thirst mechanism is sufficient to maintain the  sodium in the high-normal range. The medication desmopressin may be tried in patients who have persistent symptomatic polyuria after having the above described regimen. Several new approaches to treatment of this disorder are being investigated: V2 receptor chaperones and V2 receptor bypass.[4][6]"
"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2C","There is no specific treatment for LGMD2C. Management of the condition is based on each person's symptoms and may include:[4]Weight control to avoid obesityPhysical therapyand stretching exercises to promote mobility and preventcontracturesUse of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobilityMonitoring and surgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity andscoliosisMonitoring of respiratory function and use of respiratory aids when indicatedMonitoring for evidence of diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)Social and emotional support and stimulation to maximize a sense of social involvement and productivity and to reduce the sense of social isolation common in these disorders"
Adie syndrome,"Doctors may prescribe reading glasses to compensate for impaired vision in the affected eye, andpilocarpine dropsto be applied 3 times daily to constrict the dilated pupil. This may help with depth perception and reduce glare. For many, these strategies improve vision.[1][2]Thoracic sympathectomy, which severs the involved sympathetic nerve, is the definitive treatment for excessive sweating.[1]"
