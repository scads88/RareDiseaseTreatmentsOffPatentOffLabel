Gardner-Diamond syndrome,"There is no specific treatment for Gardner-Diamondsyndrome(GDS).[4]It has been suggested that psychiatric treatment (including psychotherapy) is the only reasonable therapeutic option.[1]In some people, psychiatric medications for mental illness have helped to improve the symptoms. For example, in a person with GDS and an underlying personality disorder, medications used to treat the personality disorder may help with the symptoms of GDS.[3]Due to the presumed psychological nature of the disease, placebo effect has been used successfully to ease the severity of symptoms.[4]It has been proposed that certain medications used to alter the tonus of the capillaries (how they contract), the permeability of the vessels, and/or the flowing properties of the blood may be useful for some people.[3]Symptomatic therapy may be helpful for severe, general symptoms. Several approaches including antihistamines,corticosteroids, antidepressants,hormones, and vitamins have had variable success.[4]"
Autoimmune atrophic gastritis,"The treatment of autoimmune atrophic gastritis is generally focused on preventing or treatingvitamin B12andiron deficiencies. Ifpernicious anemiais already present at the time of diagnosis,  vitamin B12shots (injections) may be recommended. Since dietary and oraliron supplementsdo not usually improve iron levels, alternative iron therapy approaches may include receiving periodicintravenous(IV) iron (iron infusion) to increase iron stores or a daily dose of oral ferrous glycine sulfate to meet daily iron requirements. People with autoimmune atrophic gastritis should have their levels of B12and iron monitored for the rest of their life.[1][2][3]In some cases,periodic endoscopymay also be recommended due to the increased risk of certain types ofcancer.[1][2][3]"
Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy,"Since autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is so rare, no standard treatments have been established.[1][2][3]Experts familiar with this condition often useplasma exchangeor total plasmapheresis,intravenous immunoglobulin(IVIG), IVcorticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs, such asRituxanto treat the symptoms of the disease.[2]A therapeutic trial for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathywas recently completed by the Autonomic Disorders Consortium.[1]"
Evans syndrome,"The best treatment options for Evanssyndromedepend on many factors, including the severity of the condition; the signs and symptoms present; and each person's response to certain therapies. For example, people who need to be hospitalized due to severeanemiaorthrombocytopeniaare often treated withblood transfusionsfollowed by therapy withcorticosteroidsorintravenous (IV) immune globulin. Other treatment options include immunosuppressive drugs.[1]Most affected individuals respond to these treatments; however, relapse is frequent.[6]In people who do not respond to standard treatments, therapy withrituximaborsplenectomymay be considered. Some people with Evans syndrome respond well to rituximab treatment and experience an extended period ofremission, while others have little to no response.[6]People undergoing splenectomy may show immediate improvement; however, relapses are common and, in most cases, occur within 1-2 months after the procedure.[1]For cases that are very severe and difficult to treat, astem cell transplantmay be used to provide a long-term cure.[6]Autologous and allogeneicstem celltransplantation have been used in a small number of patients (14 patients aged 5-52 years), with mixed results.[1]"
Lymphocytic hypophysitis,"Lymphocytic hypophysitis can evolve differently among affected individuals, so different treatment strategies may be required. Some individuals experience spontaneousremission(improvement or reversal of the condition without any formal treatment). Careful follow-up is typically recommended.[1]Many affected individuals only have headaches as a manifesting symptom, and there have been multiple reports of these individuals improving withglucocorticoidsalone.[4]Although the use of glucocorticoids or other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs have been suggested as medical treatment, their long-term efficacy still needs to be confirmed. High-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy (short, intensive administration given at set intervals) seems to be effective in about 30% of treated patients.[1]Transsphenoidal surgery(accessed ""through the nose"") to confirm diagnosis and save viable pituitarytissuemay be required in individuals with symptoms or signs of severe compression.[1]Visual improvement following decompression with this type of surgery has been reported.[4]In some cases, pituitarybiopsyis both diagnostic and therapeutic, because after this procedure a progressive recovery of pituitary function may occur.[1]"
Lewy body dementia,The Lewy Body Dementia Associationoffers detailed and up-to-date information regarding the treatment and management of Lewy bodydementia. Please click on the link to access this resource.
Dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa,"There is currently no cure for all types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). Treatment generally focuses on managing signs and symptoms. For some individuals, such as those that have a mild form of dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB), dystrophic nails may be the only manifestation. However, other individuals may have much more severe problems that need to be managed. Management typically focuses on treating blisters and avoiding or treating infections.[4]Wound care usually included treatment of new blisters by lancing and draining. Additionally in most cases, wounds are then dressed with a non-adherent material, covered with padding for stability and protection, and secured with an elastic wrap for integrity. Due to the increased risk of bacterial resistance, topicalantibioticointments and antimicrobial dressings should be reserved for those wounds that are colonized withbacteriaand fail to heal, referred to as “critical colonization.""[4][5]Individuals with epidermolysis bullosa (EB)  have increased caloric andproteinneeds due to the increased energy utilized in wound healing. Involvement of the digestive system in some forms of EB may limit nutritional intake. Infants and children with more severe forms of EB andfailure to thriveusually require attention tofluid and electrolyte balanceand may require nutritional support, including agastrotomy feeding tube.Anemiais typically treated with iron supplements and transfusions as needed. Other nutritional supplements may include calcium, vitamin D, selenium, carnitine, and zinc.[4][5]Surveillance is important for individuals with DEB.Biopsiesof abnormal-appearing wounds that do not heal may be recommended in some types of DEB due to predisposition tosquamous cell carcinoma, beginning in the second decade of life.Screeningfor deficiencies of iron, zinc, vitamin D, selenium, and carnitine is typically recommended after the first year of life. Routineechocardiogramsare recommended to identifydilated cardiomyopathy, andbone mineral density studiesare recommended to identifyosteoporosis. Activities and bandages that may traumatize the skin (including all adhesives) should typically be avoided.[4]Recent treatment advancements and therapies under investigation include but are not limited to[4][5][9]:Use of biological dressings to treat chronic or recurrent skin ulcersBone marrow transplantationIntra-dermal (in the skin) injection offibroblastsProtein replacement therapy (intra-dermal injection of type VII collagen)Gene therapyRevertant mosaicismGenecorrection technologies (ex.CRISPR)DEBRA International has developed clinical practice guidelines for different aspects of treating EB including wound care and pain management. Click on thelinkto see their completed guidelines."
Hemochromatosis type 4,"Treatment for hemochromatosis type 4 depends on whether the affected person has hemochromatosis type 4A or hemochromatosis type 4B. People with hemochromatosis type 4B can be treated similarly to people who have other types of hemochromatosis. Treatment options may include reducing iron levels by removing blood (phlebotomy),iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications of the disease.[2]Treatment for people with hemochromatosis type 4A typically does not involve phlebotomy. This is because people with hemochromatosis type 4A may develop low levels ofred blood cells(anemia) if they receive phlebotomy treatments. Instead, people with hemochromatosis type 4A are closely monitored with blood tests to determine if they are having symptoms of the disease and how the disease may best be treated.[2][5]Dietary recommendations for people with hemochromatosis may include avoiding alcohol and red meat. People with hemochromatosis are not recommended to take iron or vitamin C supplements.[8]For more detailed information regarding the treatment of hemochromatosis, please reference theMedscape article about hemochromatosis.You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free."
PACS1-related syndrome,"The treatment of PACS1-relatedsyndromedepends on the signs and symptoms present in each person. When a child or adult is first diagnosed with PACS1-related syndrome, a number of tests and consultations may be recommended including:[2][4]Meeting with a dietician to discuss any feeding problemsEEGto assess if there are anyseizuresoccurringBrain MRIto look for any brain abnormalitiesConsultation with anophthalmologistto assess for any eye abnormalitiesUltrasoundof heart and kidneys.Although there is no cure for PACS1-related syndrome, there are treatment and therapy options that can help manage many of the signs and symptoms of the syndrome.Anti-epileptic medicationscan be used to help control seizures. Sometimes, children with PACS1-related syndrome may need feeding tubes to help them get enough nutrients. Children with PACS1-related syndrome may be recommended to be followed by a developmentalpediatrician, and they may benefit fromspeech,physical, andoccupationaltherapy. Some children and adults with PACS1-related syndrome are better able to communicate if they learn sign language or have an electronic device to help them communicate.[2][3][4]"
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy,"Unfortunately, no definitive treatments for LGMD exist. Management depends on each individual and the specific type of LGMD that the individual has. However, theAmerican Academy of Neurologyhas developed guidelines for treatment of  LGMD including:[5][6]Weight control to avoid obesityPhysical therapyand stretching exercises to promote mobility and preventcontractures(fixed tightening of the muscles)Use of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobilityMonitoring and surgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications, such as foot deformity andscoliosisMonitoring respiratory function and use of respiratory aids when neededMonitoring for evidence ofcardiomyopathyin the types of LGMD with known occurrence of cardiac involvementMonitoring of weight given the potential for swallowing issues (dysphagia) and use of nutritional supplementation as neededSocial and emotional support and stimulation to maximize a sense of social involvement and productivity, and to reduce the sense of social isolation common in these disordersA team approach to treatment is recommended including aneurologist,pulmonologist,cardiologist, orthopedic surgeon,physiatrist, physical/occupational/speech therapist,nutritionist,orthopedist, mental health counselors, andgeneticist/genetic counselor.[5][6]While not a currently available treatment option, some studies have shownpromising results with the use ofgene therapy. More research is needed to prove the safety and efficacy of this treatment approach.[6]"
Autosomal dominant optic atrophy plus syndrome,"Unfortunately, there is no cure forautosomal dominantoptic atrophy plussyndrome(ADOA plus). Treatment options that may be recommended for people with ADOA plus  include:[1]Visual aids such as glasses and contact lensesHearing aidsorcochlear implantsCurrently, there are no medications that are regularly used to relieve or reverse the symptoms associated with ADOA plus. In someclinical trials, people with a disease-causing genetic change in theOPA1genehave found some improvement in vision using a medication called idebenone.[1][2]However, this medication may not be appropriate for everyone with ADOA plus, and it may only be available through research studies."
Optic atrophy 1,"Treatment for optic atrophy type 1 typically includes regular exams by anophthalmologist, including measuring vision and color vision, and regular evaluation by anaudiologist. Vision aids such as glasses, contact lenses, and magnifiers may be used to help treat vision loss.Cochlear implantsmay help improve hearing in people who havesensorineural hearing loss.[1]Some people with optic atrophy type 1 have shown improvement in vision after being treated with idebenone. However, more research is needed to determine how effective this medication is in treating the disease.[3][5]People with optic atrophy type 1 may be recommended to avoid alcohol intake and certain medications, as these can impact the function ofmitochondriain thecells.[1]"
Spastic paraplegia 4,"Care for SPG4 is usually managed by a team including aprimary care physician,neurologist, genetics professional (geneticistand/orgenetic counselor),physical therapist,social worker, andpsychologist. Treatment is focused on alleviating symptoms and may include:[3]Medications for legspasticity(antispastic drugs)Medications to assist in bladder control (anticholinergic antispasmodic drugs)Regular physician therapyBotulinum toxinandintrathecal baclofenfor severe spasticity"
Multiple pterygium syndrome Escobar type,"There is currently no cure for multiple pterygiumsyndrome, Escobar type. As a result treatment is aimed at managing the associated symptoms. Orthopedics should be involved for issues arising fromscoliosis. Infections should be treated promptly.Contracturereleases have been performed with variable outcome.Physical therapyis important to help minimize contractures. Whenptosis(droopy eyelids) is present, the individual should be referred to ophthalmology. Individuals should also be referred to audiology due to the risk of conductivehearing loss.[4]"
Noonan syndrome,"Management of Noonansyndromegenerally focuses on the specific signs and symptoms present in each person. Treatments for the complications of Noonan syndrome (such as cardiovascular problems) are generally standard and do not differ from treatment in the general population.[5]Developmental disabilities are addressed by early intervention programs. Some children with Noonan syndrome may need special help in school, including for example, anindividualized educational program(IEP).[5]Treatment for bleeding problems depends on the cause.[5]Growthhormone(GH) therapy can increase the rate at which a child with Noonan syndrome grows in most cases. GH therapy during childhood and teen years may also increase final adult height slightly, often enough to reach the low normal range of average height.[5][6]"
Spastic paraplegia 11,"Care for SPG11 is usually managed by a team including aprimary care physician,neurologist, genetics professional (geneticistand/orgenetic counselor),physical therapist,social worker, andpsychologist. Treatment is focused on alleviating symptoms and may include:Medications for legspasticity(antispastic drugs)Medications to assist in bladder control (anticholinergic antispasmodic drugs)Regular physician therapyBotulinum toxinandintrathecal baclofenfor severe spasticityRegular outpatient clinic evaluations are recommended to adjust medications andphysical therapy/rehabilitation routines. Routine brainMRIand electrophysiological investigations (muscle and nerve studies) may be useful to follow the progression of the disease.[2]"
Troyer syndrome,"There are currently no treatments known to prevent or slow the progression of Troyersyndrome.[1]Treatment aims to relieve symptoms of the disease and improve quality of life.Treatment forspasticityinvolves both exercise and medication, especiallybaclofen(Lioresal®), which is used either orally or by intrathecal pump.Tizanidine,dantrolene(with precautions), and Botox® have also been useful in reducing muscle spasticity. Dailyphysical therapyis recommended.[3]Treatment may also include:Occupational therapy, assistive walking devices, and ankle-foot orthotics as neededOxybutyninto reduce urinary urgencyAntidepressants or mood stabilizers to manage emotional or mood disorders[3]Additional information about the management of Troyer syndrome can be viewed on the GeneReviews Web site."
Protein C deficiency,"Most people with mildproteinC deficiency never develop abnormal blood clots and thus do not require treatment. However, people who have experienced adeep venous thrombosis(DVT) or apulmonary embolismare usually treated with blood-thinning drugs such asheparinorwarfarin, which help to prevent another blood clot from developing in the future.[6]Preventative treatment with these blood-thinning drugs may also be considered in those with afamily historyof blood clotting, as well as in higher risk situations such as pregnancy.[3]A protein C concentrate (Ceprotin®) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 for the treatment of protein C deficiency. High doses of intravenous protein C concentrates can help thin the blood and protect from blood clots. It can also be used a preventative treatment against blood clots during surgery, pregnancy delivery, prolonged immobility, or overwhelming infection in the blood stream (sepsis). Currently, no guidelines exist as to which patients should receive protein C concentrate. It is typically given only at times of increased risk for clotting, or when the blood thinner heparin by itself cannot be safely given because it would lead to an increased risk for bleeding. However, in those with severe protein C who have had severe bleeding complications on long-term blood thinning therapy, protein C concentrate has been used on a regular basis.[7]"
Corneal dystrophy Avellino type,"There is no cure for this condition and treatment usually focuses on alleviating symptoms, especially when vision becomes significantly impaired. Penetrating keratoplasty, which is a surgical procedure where a damaged or diseased cornea is entirely replaced by donated cornealtissue(graft), can improve vision at least temporarily but deposits tend to recur.LASIK eye surgeryhas been reported to exacerbate the number and density of the eye opacities. Patients treated with phototherapeutic keratectomy (PRK), which is a surgical procedure that uses a laser to remove tissue from the cornea, may do better and can retain corneal clarity for a decade or more.[2][3][4]"
Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome,"Ifglaucomais present, the goal of treatment is to decrease intra-ocular pressure (IOP). An annual ophthalmologic exam should be done using several specific exams to detect the presence of glaucoma. Should glaucoma develop, eye drops are usually recommended before surgery. Medications that might be prescribed include those that decrease aqueous output (beta-blockers, alpha-agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors). However, alpha-agonists should be used with caution in young children because of possible neurologic effects. Surgery is performed if eye drops are not sufficient in lowering IOP. If surgery is necessary, the procedure of choice is trabeculectomy. Laser surgery may also be indicated. Patients with corectopia (pupil is off center and not located where it should be) and polycoria (more than one pupil is present in the eye) may experience too much sensitivity to light (photophobia), and contact lenses may be helpful.[9][10]If the person has additional findings, treatment will depend on the symptoms present, and may include surgery to correct facial or dental problems, heart surgery, or corrective surgery for the cases ofhypospadia.Short staturedue to a growthhormonedeficiency may be treated with growth hormone."
Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia,"There is no specific treatment for axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. Symptoms such as lung infections, breathing difficulties, coxa vara,scoliosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and optic atrophy are managed individually. Specialists such as opthmologists,geneticists, andorthopedistswork in concert in devloping an individualized treatment plan. We are unaware of any cases describing the use of growthhormonetherapies for treatment ofshort staturecaused by axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. Treatment of skeletal dysplasias with growthhormone therapymust be done with caution.TheLittle People of America, IncWeb site lists articles on repiratory and breathing problems in people with skeletal dysplasias, including an article titled Breathing Problems Among Little People: When to Be Concerned.Detailed information related to the management of retinitis pigmentosa can be accessed throughGeneReviewsand theTreatmentandMedicationsections of Medscape Reference.Detailed information related to the management of coxa vara can also be found in theTreatmentsections of a Medscape Reference review article on this condition.Johns Hopkins Department of Orthopedic Surgery offers aPatient Guide to Scoliosis.MedlinePlus.gov provides information onoptic atrophy.Further medical support resources can be found through theLittle People of America, Inc."
Tay-Sachs disease,"Currently, there is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease, and there is no treatment that stops or slows the progression of the disease. Treatment aims to relieve some of the symptoms, manage infections, prevent complications, and increase quality of life as much as possible. Treatment for symptoms may includeanticonvulsantsto controlseizuresin children, andantipsychotic medicationsfor psychiatric disorders in adults. Of note,tricyclic antidepressantsare thought to be ineffective, and they may actually inhibit the littleenzymeactivity that may be present in some people with the disease. Preventing complications involves getting adequate nutrition and hydration, preventing airway obstruction, and avoiding severe constipation with food additives,stoolsofteners, or laxatives.[4][5]Research into potential treatments for Tay-Sachs disease is ongoing."
Tumefactive multiple sclerosis,"To
date there have been no controlled treatment studies for tumefactive
multiple sclerosis. As a result, treatment decisions are largely based
on a doctor's experience and information from single case reports.[3]In a small number of cases, people with tumefactive multiple sclerosis
have minimal to no symptoms. A reasonable approach of care in these
cases is to  monitor without treatment.[3]In most cases the
size of the lesion and resulting symptoms prompts treatment withcorticosteroids. As with other forms of multiple sclerosis,corticosteroids(for example, intravenous methylprednisolone) should be the first
line of treatment.  If corticosteroids are not effective,plasma exchangeis tried. Another second line treatment that has been tried
with some success isRituximab.[3]"
Lymphatic filariasis,"The main treatment for this disorder is the use of major anti-parasiticide drugs; examples of these includeivermectin,albendazole, anddiethylcarbamazine(DEC). These drugs work to get rid of the larval worm, to inhibit reproduction of the adult worm, or to kill the adult worm.[2]For individuals who are actively infected with the filarial parasite, DEC is typically the drug of choice in the United States. The drug kills the microfilaria and some of the adult worms. DEC has been used world-wide for more than 50 years. Because this infection is rare in the U.S., the drug is no longer approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and cannot be sold in the United.States. Physicians can typically obtain the medication from the CDC after confirmed positive lab results. DEC is generally well tolerated. Side effects are in general limited and depend on the number of microfilariae in the blood. The most common side effects are dizziness, nausea, fever, headache, or pain in muscles or joints. Another treatment option, ivermectin, kills only the microfilariae.[3]For individuals with clinical symptoms of the condition, treatment depends on the signs and symptoms the affected individual has.Lymphedemaand elephantiasis are not typically indications for DEC treatment because most people with lymphedema are not actively infected with the filarial parasite. To prevent the lymphedema from getting worse, individuals should ask their physician for a referral to a lymphedema therapist so they can be informed about some basic principles of care such as hygiene, exercise and treatment of wounds.[3]Men withhydrocele(abnormal accumulation of fluid in the scrotum) may have evidence of active infection, but typically do not improve clinically following treatment with DEC. The treatment for hydrocele is surgery.[2][3]Surgery may also be performed to remove the remains of adult worms and calcifications developing around them. Treatment of elephantiasis of the legs usually consists of elevation and support from elastic stockings.[2]In the tropical areas of the world, mosquito control is an important part of prevention of filariasis. Filariasis is usually a self-limited disease unless reinfection occurs. Therefore some cases, especially those brought into temperate regions of the world (i.e., North America), may be left untreated because there is no danger of spreading the disease.[2]"
Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome,"Treatment is based on the specific signs and symptoms present in the individual.Screeningrecommendations for BRRS have not been established; however, recent studies have suggested that people with BRRS, especially those with a knownmutationin their PTENgene, should undergo increased surveillance ofcanceraffecting the breast, thyroid, endometrial, and kidney.[1]"
Bardet-Biedl syndrome,"There is no cure for Bardet-Biedlsyndrome. Treatment generally focuses on the specific signs and symptoms in each individual:While there is no therapy for the progressive vision loss, early evaluation by a specialist can help to provide vision aids and mobility training. Additionally, education of affected children should include planning for future blindness.Management of obesity may include education, diet, exercise, and behavioral therapies beginning at an early age. Complications of obesity such as abnormally high cholesterol anddiabetes mellitusare usually treated as they are in the general population.Management of intellectual disability includes early intervention, special education and speech therapy as needed. Many affected adults are able to develop independent living skills.Although kidney transplants have been successful, the immunosuppressants used after a transplant may contribute to obesity. Affected individuals may also need surgery forpolydactyly(extra fingers and/or toes) or genital abnormalities.As children approach puberty,hormonelevels should be monitored to determine if hormone replacement therapy is necessary. Additionally, it should not be assumed that affected individuals are infertile - so contraception advice should be offered.[6]"
Barrett esophagus,"The treatment of Barrett esophagus largely depends on the severity of the condition as determined by thelevel of dysplasiaseen onbiopsy. In people with no dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia, treatment is often focused on easing the signs and symptoms ofgastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause further damage to the esophagus. This may include certain medications and lifestyle modifications such as avoiding smoking; eliminating food and drinks that trigger heartburn; raising the head of the bed while sleeping; and/or avoiding late night snacking. Periodicendoscopymay also be recommended to monitor Barrett esophagus as other treatments may be indicated if the condition advances.[2][3]Because high-grade dysplasia is thought to be the final step beforecellschange intoesophageal cancer, more aggressive treatments are typically recommended. These may include:[2][5][[3]Endoscopic resection - anendoscopeis used to remove damaged cellsEndoscopic ablative therapies - different techniques such as photodynamic therapy or radiofrequency ablation are used to destroy the dysplasia in the esophagus. In photodynamic therapy, abnormal cells are destroyed by making them sensitive to light, while radiofrequency ablation uses heat to remove abnormal esophagustissue.Surgery - the damaged part of the esophagus is removed and the remaining portion is attached to the stomachTheNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases'(NIDDK) Web site offers more specific information on the treatment and management of Barret esophagus. Please click on the link to access this resource."
Barth syndrome,"The treatment of Barthsyndromeis generally directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of medical professionals which includes apediatrician, pediatriccardiologist,hematologist, specialist in the treatment of bacterial infections,physical therapist,occupational therapist, and/or other health care professionals. Many infants and children with Barth syndrome require therapy with diuretic and digitalis medications to treat heart failure. Some affected children are gradually removed from such cardiac therapy during later childhood due to improvement of heart functioning. For affected individuals with confirmed neutropenia, complications due to bacterial infection are often preventable by ongoing monitoring and early therapy of suspected infections withantibiotics. For example, antibiotics may be provided as a preventive (prophylactic) therapy during neutropenia to prevent the onset of infection. Other treatment for this disorder is typically symptomatic and supportive.[1]"
Bartter syndrome,"Treatment of Barttersyndromedepends on the specific symptoms present in each individual and may require the coordinated efforts of a team of specialists. The primary focus of treatment is on restoring the proper balance of fluids and electrolytes in the body.[3]This may include oral potassium (K) supplements, medication such asindomethacin, andpotassium-sparing diuretics. In high-stress situations such as illness or trauma, blood electrolyte levels can change rapidly, which may require immediate intravenous treatment.[2][3]Genetic counselingmay benefit affected individuals and their families.[3]Medscape Reference has an article containing additional, detailed information about the management and treatment of Bartter syndrome.Click hereto view this information."
Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome,"The features of nevoid basalcellcarcinomasyndrome(NBCCS) should be evaluated and treated by specialists who are experienced with the condition (such as oral surgeons,dermatologists,plastic surgeons, and medicalgeneticists).If a medulloblastoma is detected early enough, it may be treated by surgery andchemotherapy.[4]Jaw keratocysts usually need to be surgically removed. Early treatment of basal cell carcinomas is necessary to prevent long-term cosmetic problems, particularly on the face. Surgical removal is often supplemented by other treatments such as cryotherapy, laser treatment, and/or photodynamic therapy.[2]Radiation therapyis not recommended because it can provoke the development of moretumors.[4]Some people may need long term treatment with oral retinoids such asisotretinoinoracitretin.Cardiac fibromas may not cause symptoms, but they should be monitored by acardiologist. If ovarian fibromas need surgical treatment, it is typically recommended that ovariantissueis preserved even though it involves a risk of recurrence.[2]"
Migraine with brainstem aura,"During an episode of migraine with brainstem aura (MBA), people are usually treated withnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)andantiemeticmedications to help ease the symptoms. In some cases, anerve blockcan be used to treat pain if other therapies are not working. In people with episodes  that are frequent, prolonged, or particularly debilitating, medications such asverapamilortopiramatemay be prescribed as a preventative therapy.[2]"
Giant congenital nevus,"Treatment for giantcongenitalnevus depends on the age of the affected individual as well as the size, location, and thickness of the nevus. Surgery may be done to remove the nevus, particularly when there is a concern that it may develop into amelanoma.[1]When small nevi are removed, the surrounding skin can often be pulled together with stitches. Larger nevi may need to be removed in several stages and full-thicknessskin graftsmay be needed to help the skin heal following surgery.[1][2]When surgery is not possible, other treatment may include procedures such as curettage, dermabrasion, and ablative laser therapy which  may be used for superficial skin imperfections, including reducing pigment and hair, but cannot completely remove the nevus.[2][3][5][4]Affected individuals should self-monitor and continue to have regular skin examinations to check for benign or malignanttumors. Early awareness will allow their physicians  to adjust treatment protocols  accordingly.[1]Children are most likely to show neurological signs before primary school and can respond well to a range of symptomatic therapies.[2]"
Baylisascaris infection,"No drug has been found to be completely effective in treatingBaylisascarisinfections in humans.[4]Albendazole is currently considered to be the drug of choice.Corticosteroidsmay also be given to reduce inflammation. In many cases, significant damage has already occurred by the time treatment has started. Early diagnosis and treatment provide the best chance of recovery.[5]"
Opitz G/BBB syndrome,"Because of the wide range of signs and symptoms that may be present in affected individuals, management of Opitz G/BBBsyndrometypically incorporates a multidisciplinary team consisting of various specialists. Treatment for the condition may include surgery for significant abnormalities involving the larynx, trachea and/or esophagus; surgical intervention as needed for hypospadias,cleft lipand/orcleft palate, and imperforate anus; therapy for speech problems; surgical repair as needed for heart defects; neuropsychological support; and special education services.[3]"
Epidermolytic ichthyosis,"At this time, there is no cure for epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI) and treatment is a challenge.[4][5]The main goal of therapy is to ease the symptoms. This may be achieved with the following, sometimes in combination:Topical keratolytics (medications which help shed outer layers of skin) - examples include lactic acid,alpha-hydroxy acid, orurea.Topicalemollients(products that soften the skin)Topical retinoidsororal retinoids- these can significantly improve symptoms, but care must be taken to avoid causing increased skin fragility.[6]Antiseptic washescan reduce the risk for bacterial infections so as to avoid frequentantibiotictherapy.[1]When blistering is severe, treatment is focused on wound healing and preventing infection.[4]Affected newborns with open skin lesions  should be transferred to the neonatal ICU to be monitored and treated for infections as needed. They should be handled gently to avoid further trauma to the skin.[6]The Foundation for Ichthyosis and Related Skin Types (FIRST) has a webpage with ""Tools & Tips for Living with Ichthyosis."" This page contains links to information about varies strategies for daily living and care."
Hailey-Hailey disease,"There is no specific treatment for Hailey-Hailey disease and management generally focuses on the specific symptoms and severity in each person.People with Hailey-Hailey disease are encouraged to avoid ""triggers"" such as sunburn, sweating, and friction, and to keep the affected areas dry. Sunscreen, loose clothing, moisturizing creams, and avoiding excessive heat may help prevent outbreaks.[3]Trying to prevent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in the affected areas is also important, and drugs used to treat or prevent these infections are commonly used.[3][6]Topical medications (such as mildcorticosteroid creamsand topicalantibiotics) may improve symptoms in milder forms.[3][6]Cool compresses and dressings may also help.[3]More severe cases may require systemic antibiotics (especially erythromycin and tetracycline) and/or strongercorticosteroidcreams.[3]Topical tacrolimusointment can be used to control the disease, even without the use of topical corticosteroids.[4]When the disease does not improve with these treatments  and it is widespread, additional treatment options may include:[4][7]Corticosteroid injections,Laser ablationtherapy (such as CO2 ablation laser)Radiofrequency (RF) surgeryPhotodynamic therapy (PDT)Electron beam radiotherapyBotulinum toxin type A (BTX-A)DermabrasionTopical cadexomer iodine powderOraldapsoneOralmethothrexateOral retinoids (isotretinoin or acitretin)Injections ofafamelanotideOral glycopyrrolateInjections of alefaceptBotulinumtoxin, CO2ablation laser, and dermabrasion are the most studied and have shown to be effective treatments. Some reports show that low-dose botulinum toxin type A injections should be given first in hard-to-treat cases because it is well-tolerated, effective, and has few or mild negative side effects.[7]"
