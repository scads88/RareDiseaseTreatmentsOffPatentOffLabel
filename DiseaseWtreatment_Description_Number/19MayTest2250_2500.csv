Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Relapsing polychondritis,"The primary goals of treatment for people with relapsing polychondritis (RP) are to relieve present symptoms and to preserve the structure of the affected cartilage. The main treatment for RP iscorticosteroidtherapy withprednisoneto decrease the severity, frequency and duration of relapses. Higher doses are generally given during flares, while lower doses can typically be prescribed during periods ofremission. Other medications reported to control symptoms includedapsone,colchicine,azathioprine,methotrexate,cyclophosphamide,hydroxychloroquine,cyclosporineandinfliximab.[5][10]People who develop severe heart or respiratory complications may require surgery.[6]More detailed information about the management of RP is available on Medscape Reference's Web site and can be viewed by clickinghere."
Chronic fatigue syndrome,"Treatment options for chronic fatiguesyndrome(CFS) are limited.[3]Treatment is largely supportive and is focused on the specific symptoms present in each individual.[6]In most cases, symptoms of CFS lessen over time.[7]Several therapies have been researched, but there is, unfortunately, no strong evidence to suggest that any of the studied therapies are beneficial to those affected by CFS. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy initially appeared to show some promise, further evaluation utilizing better diagnostic criteria for the condition and separating CBT from other counseling and behavioral interventions suggests that the evidence for CBT and GET as effective treatments is of very poor quality.[8]A number of medications, special diets and vitamin supplements have been evaluated in individuals with CFS, but none have been proven effective.[6][7]Although there have been a number ofvirusesthat were initially reported to cause CFS, additional studies have not supported this.[3]Trials of antiviral agents have been ineffective in relieving the symptoms of CFS.[6]Severalclinical trialsaiming to find effective treatment are currently ongoing.Other disorders that may be present, such asfibromyalgia,irritable bowel syndrome,metabolic syndrome, sleep disorders, and depression should be treated when caring for patients.[4][3]"
Chronic granulomatous disease,"Chronic granulomatous disease is usually managed withantibioticand antifungal medications to treat and prevent infection.Corticosteriodsmay be used to shrink granulomas (areas of inflamedtissue). Treatment may also include a medication called Actimmune (also known asinterferon gamma-1b). Actimmune is a man-made version of a substance normally produced by the body's immunecellsand has been shown to decrease the frequency of severe infections in people with chronic granulomatous disease.[1][2][4][5][6]Early diagnosis of infection is very important, so people with chronic granulomatous disease are generally followed closely by a medical professional. The frequency of follow-up will depend on the severity of the condition.[1][2][4]Abone marrow transplant(allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantationor HSCT) may be used to treat and possibly cure chronic granulomatous disease, however HSCT has serious risks including the possibility of severe disability or death. Although the risks associated with HSCT are decreasing due to medical advances, HSCT is usually only considered for those severely affected by chronic granulomatous disease.[1][2][4][5]Medical researchers believegene therapyalso holds great promise as a future cure, but moreclinical studiesare needed to determine if gene therapy will be both safe and effective for those with chronic granulomatous disease.[4][5]As medical researchers better understand  chronic granulomatous disease, new treatments that help control theimmune system(immunomodulatory agents) may also become available.[6]"
Chronic hiccups,"Treatment for chronic hiccups often varies based on the underlying cause. In many cases, medications can be prescribed to treat chronic hiccups. These may include:[1][2]Tranquilizers such aschlorpromazineandhaloperidolMuscle relaxantsAnticonvulsant agents includingphenytoin,valproic acid, andcarbamazepineSedativesPain medicationsStimulantsRarely, medications may not be effective in the treatment of chronic hiccups. In these cases, surgery to temporarily or permanently block the phrenic nerve may be performed. The phrenic nerve controls the diaphragm.[2]"
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,"Standard treatment options for CIDP include:[2][5][6]intravenous immune globulin(IVIG) - adds large numbers ofantibodiesto the blood plasma to reduce the effect of the antibodies that are causing the problemglucocorticoids- help reduce inflammation and relieve symptomsplasma exchange - removes harmful antibodies from the bloodThe choice of treatment may depend on the preference of the patient, side effects, treatment cost, duration, and availability.[6]There are advantages and disadvantages of each treatment option:[6]IVIG and plasma exchange may lead to a more rapid improvement in CIDP than glucocorticoid therapy, but are less likely than glucocorticoids to produce aremissionIVIG is expensive, and its supply is sometimes limitedGlucocorticoids are inexpensive, but chronic use is limited by common and important side effectsPlasma exchange is expensive, invasive, and available only at specialized centersOther drugs may be used when standard treatments fail or cause significant side-effects.[5]Physical therapymay improve muscle strength, function and mobility.[1]"
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"The best treatment for each person with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) depends on many factors, including whether a person has symptoms, the stage of the condition, results of various tests, and whether the CLL hasrecurred(come back).[1]For example, people with early stage CLL who have no symptoms may simply be closely monitored by their doctor without any treatment (watchful waiting).[2]When a person develops symptoms, or there are signs thecancerhas progressed, treatment options may include:[2][3][1]ChemotherapyRadiation therapyTargeted therapy-  drugs or other substances used to find and kill cancercellswithout hurting normal cells. Examples includemonoclonal antibody therapy,tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and BCL2 inhibitor therapy.Blood orplatelettransfusions if blood counts are lowBone marroworstem cell transplantation- in younger patients with advanced or aggressive CLLSurgery - for example, spleen removal (splenectomy) for enlarged spleen and low blood countsMore information about the treatment of CLL can be viewed on theNational Cancer Institute's page about CLL treatment."
Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis,"Due to the rare nature of the condition, there is limited data regarding the best treatment approach for people with chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). When CRMO occurs along withpsoriasisorinflammatory bowel diseasethe goal is to treat both the CRMO as well as the skin and gastrointestinal symptoms. In this situation, treatment with aTNF inhibitormay be recommended. Initial treatment of isolated CRMO often involvesNSAIDs. If NSAIDs are unable to control pain, additional treatment options include antirheumatic drugs (e.g.,corticosteroids,methotrexate,sulfasalazine,colchicine, andazithromycin), TNF inhibitors, or bisphosphonates.[1]"
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome,"Because research suggests that postural orthostatic tachycardiasyndrome(POTS) has a variety of causes, no single treatment is effective for all affected people. Management of POTS aims to improve low blood pressure and problems with the heart and blood vessels that may be causing the condition. In some people with POTS, simple lifestyle changes such as adding extra salt to the diet, drinking more fluids, exercising, and avoiding factors that make the condition worse, may lessen symptoms. Certain medications may also be helpful in treating POTS.[1][2][4]Some researches suggest volume repletion andfludrocortisone(0.05 to 0.2 mg per day) as the first line of therapy. Some patients may benefit frommidodrineor beta blocking agents. Other treatment options remain under investigation, and further confirmation of benefit is needed before they can be recommended.[4]"
Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia,"Ptosiscaused by chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) can be corrected by surgery, or by using glasses that have a “ptosis crutch” to lift the upper eyelids.[4]Strabismus surgerycan be helpful in carefully selected patients if diplopia (double vision) occurs.[5]Some individuals with a deficiency of coenzyme Q10 have CPEO as an associated abnormality. Coenzyme Q10 is important for normal mitochondrial function. In individuals with this deficiency, supplemental coenzyme Q10 has been found to improve general neurologic function and exercise tolerance. However, coenzyme Q10 has not been shown to improve the ophthalmoplegia or ptosis in people who have isolated CPEO.[1]"
Kearns-Sayre syndrome,"Treatment for Kearns-Sayresyndromeis generally symptomatic and supportive.[2]Management options include placement of cardiac pacemakers in individuals with cardiac conduction blocks, eyelid slings for severeptosis, cochlear implants and hearing aids for neurosensoryhearing loss,hormonereplacement for endocrinopathies, dilation of the upper esophageal sphincter to alleviatecricopharyngeal achalasia, folinic acid supplementation in individuals with Kearns-Sayre syndrome with low cerebral spinal fluid folic acid, administration of coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine, physical and occupational therapy, and treatment of depression. Antioxidants may ameliorate damage from reactive oxygen species; percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy may improve nutritional intake and prevent aspiration pneumonia in individuals with severedysphagia. Surveillance includesEKGand echocardiogram every six to 12 months and yearlyaudiometryand endocrinologic evaluation.[1]"
Schnitzler syndrome,The treatment of Schnitzlersyndromeis aimed at alleviating the signs and symptoms associated with the condition. The following medications have been used with variable success:[1][2][3]Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)CorticosteroidsImmunosuppressive agentsInterleukin-1 receptor antagonists (medications that inhibit the cytokine IL-1)ColchicineDapsoneThalidomideRituximabSome studies suggest thatphototherapymay improve the rash in some affected people.[1][2]Medscape Referenceand theNational Organization for Rare Disordersboth offer additional information regarding the treatment and management of Schnitzler syndrome.

Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma,"There is currently no cure for nonbullouscongenitalichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE). Treatment generally focuses on managing the specific signs and symptoms each individual has. For newborns, the most important goals are to provide a moist environment in an isolette, and to prevent and treat infections. Petrolatum-based creams and ointments are typically used to keep the skin soft and hydrated. As children age, keratolytic agents (agents that help the skin loosen and shed) such as alpha-hydroxy acid or urea preparations can be used to promote the peeling and thinning of the outer layer of the skin. For individuals with severe skin involvement, oral retinoid therapy may be recommended. However, because this is known to cause abnormalities in a developing fetus, it should be used with caution in women of child-bearing age. In general, any agents that irritate the skin should be avoided. Ectropion (turning out of the eyelid) can cause dryness of the cornea (especially at night), so artificial tears or prescription ointments may be used to keep the cornea moist.[2]ClinicalTrials.govprovides access to information onclinical studies(including therapies) for different types of ichthyosis. To view a list of the studies currently listed,click here."
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,"There is no treatment that can cure or control Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Researchers have tested many drugs, includingamantadine,steroids,interferon,acyclovir, antiviral agents, andantibiotics. Studies of a variety of other drugs are now in progress. However, so far none of these treatments has shown any consistent benefit in humans.[1]Current treatment for CJD is aimed at alleviating symptoms and making the patient as comfortable as possible. Opiate drugs can help relieve pain if it occurs, and the drugsclonazepamandsodium valproatemay help relievemyoclonus. During later stages of the disease, changing the person’s position frequently can keep him or her comfortable and helps prevent bedsores. Acathetercan be used to drain urine if the patient cannot control bladder function, and intravenous fluids and artificial feeding also may be used.[1]"
Classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"The treatment of classical EDS varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, children withhypotoniaand/or delayed motor milestones may benefit fromphysical therapyandoccupational therapy. These treatments can also help improve joint stability. Assistive devices such as braces may also be necessary depending on the severity of joint instability.Anti-inflammatory medicationsmay be prescribed for joint pain. Because classical EDS is associated with fragile skin with abnormal wound healing, people with thesyndrome, especially children, may need to wear protective bandages or pads over exposed areas, such as the knees, shins, and forehead. Children and adolescents may be monitored for the development of aortic root dilatation (enlargement of the blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body).[2][4]Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."
Hemochromatosis type 1,"Treatment for hemochromatosis type 1 may include reducing iron levels by removing blood (phlebotomy),iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications of the disease. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of iron in the body to normal levels, prevent or delayorgandamage from excess iron, and maintain normal amounts of iron throughout the lifetime.[1]Phlebotomy helps to remove excess iron from the body. Most people begin treatment with weekly therapeutic phlebotomy, although sometimes treatment is initially twice a week if iron levels are very elevated. Maintenance phlebotomy usually involves treatment every 2-4 months.[6]Iron chelation therapy may be recommended for some people with hemochromatosis type 1 if they have other health issues. This involves removing excess iron using medications.[6]Dietary recommendations for people with hemochromatosis may include avoiding alcohol and red meat. People with hemochromatosis are not recommended to take iron or vitamin C supplements.[6]For more detailed information regarding the treatment of hemochromatosis, please reference theMedscape article about hemochromatosis.You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free."
Hemophilia A,"People withinheritedhemophilia A require life-long care, preferably through a specialized hemophilia treatment center. Although there is no cure for hemophilia A, current treatments usually work well. Treatment primarily consists of replacing the missing clotting factor VIII (replacement therapy) and preventing complications that are associated with the disorder. The type and frequency of treatment often depends on the severity of the disorder in each person.People with mild or moderate hemophilia A may be treated with replacement therapy as needed (for example, when a specific bleeding episode occurs). This is called episodic therapy. Some people with mild hemophilia A may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). Desmopressin raises the levels of factor VIII in the blood and may be taken intravenously or through a nasal spray. Drugs known as antifibrinolytics, which slow the breakdown of clotting factors in the blood, can also be used to treat those with a mild form of the disorder.Some people with severe hemophilia A may receive periodic factor VIII infusions to prevent bleeding episodes and associated complications such as joint damage. This is referred to asprophylactictherapy.People can be trained to give infusions at home. This is especially important for people with severe disease because the infusion works the best within one hour of a bleeding episode. In general, rapid treatment is important because it reduces pain and damage to the joints, muscles or other affectedtissuesororgans.[5]"
Cleidocranial dysplasia,"There is no specific treatment for cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), and management is based on each person's symptoms. Most people with CCD need dental care due to various dental abnormalities. Ifbone densityis below normal, supplements ofcalciumandvitamin Dmay be needed, and preventive treatment forosteoporosismay be started at a young age. Those with frequent ear infections may needear tubes. Severe defects of the cranial vault  (space in the skull occupied by the brain) should be protected by wearing helmets during high-risk activities. Surgery may be needed to correct any of various skeletal (bone) abnormalities.[1]"
Hidradenocarcinoma,"Because hidradenocarcinoma is quite rare, there are no established guidelines for treatment.   The most accepted form of treatment iswide local excisionof thetumor, but due to the high risk that the tumor will grow back and frequentmetastasisto nearbylymph nodesand other parts of the body, some doctors also suggestradiation therapyand/orchemotherapyafter surgery.[1][2]Newer targeted therapies liketrastuzumab,epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors (targets a pathway believed to be involved in controllingcellgrowth and division), hormonal agents likeantiandrogens, and electrochemotherapy (the use of electrical pulses to help get the chemo drugs into thecancercells) may also be offered.  Most of these therapies have only been reported in isolated case reports and often with conflicting results. Therefore it is difficult to determine which therapy or combination of therapies are the best treatment option. Options are usually determined by the size and location of the cancer and the extent to which cancer cells may have spread to nearbytissues..  Many researchers are hoping if there is a better understanding of the molecular genetic changes which happen in the cells of hidradenocarcinoma, the use of targeted therapies will improve long termprognosis.[1][2]"
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"There are several treatments for metastatic clearcellrenal cell carcinoma available in North America.IL-2andsunitinib- as well as the medicationstemsirolimus,bevacizumabwithinterferon therapy,pazopanib, andsorafenib- are approved by theFood and Drug Administrationfor the treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.[2]Because a cure for this disease has yet to be discovered, theNational Cancer Institutesuggests that individuals with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma consider participation in a research study.[3]IL-2 is offered as a treatment for this disease in some individuals because it has been shown to cause a complete disappearance of signs of this disease (remission) in 5% of treated patients.[3]As IL-2 may cause toxic side effects, it is most appropriate for patients who are in excellent health.[2]Sunitinib is offered because it has been shown to stabilize metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma by stopping the disease from getting worse.  Individuals treated with sunitinib showed no change in their disease for an average of 11 months.[3]"
Spina bifida,"Treatment for spina bifida usually involves a team of specialists and varies depending on the severity. Mild cases may not require treatment. However, the majority of children with spina bifida are treated shortly after birth to decrease the risk of infection. Standard treatment includesantibiotics, surgery  to close the opening in the spine, and placement of aventriculoperitoneal shuntto managehydrocephalus. While surgery may prevent worsening of symptoms, it cannot restore lost function. In some cases diagnosed during pregnancy,in-utero fetal surgerymay be an option.[2][3][4]In some cases, the condition is life-threatening and is not treatable.[2]Depending on the extent of spinal cord involvement, treatment may also include management of motility (movement), development, bladder, and bowel concerns. Weakness or paralysis of the feet and legs might be addressed with occupational andphysical therapy, corrective shoes, braces, crutches, or other devices.[2][3][5]Long-term physical, occupational, and/or speech therapy may be needed.[2]"
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 7,"The current treatment for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is symptomatic and supportive.[1][2]Seizures, anxiety, sleep disorders, andspasticitymay be treated withbenzodiazepines.Trihexyphenydilmay help improvedystonia, Parkinsonian symptoms, andsialorrhea. Individuals who have difficulty swallowing may benefit from the placement of agastric (G) tube. Certain medications (carbamazepine,phenytoin,lamotrigine) should be avoided as they can exacerbate symptoms of the condition.[1]Future treatments may involvestem celltransplantation,enzymereplacement,gene therapy, and/or immune therapy.[1][2]"
CLOVES syndrome,"Treatment for CLOVESsyndromeinvolves addressing each symptom or complication and improving quality of life (palliative care).[5]There is currently no cure. Palliative care aims to relieve symptoms caused by masses and minimize disease progression and disability. Management is very individualized because symptoms can vary in severity and body location for each person. Follow-up with various specialists is recommended every 6 months until the end of puberty, to assess for overgrowth and complications.[2]Medical treatment may includeembolizationand surgical removal of masses, especially those that are large, deep, or in the spinal region.[2]Sclerotherapymay be used in adults to lessen pain and reduce the size of vascular and lymphatic malformations.[2]Orthopedic and neurosurgical checkups with possible surgical intervention are needed to reduce complications from overgrowth. Surveillance of hands, feet, and limb abnormalities is important so surgery can be done promptly to minimize limb disfigurement and loss of function. Because there is increased risk oftumorgrowth in people with overgrowth syndromes, people with CLOVES syndrome should have surveillance for tumors and have masses assessed.[2]In general, the earlier surveillance and intervention are started, the better the outcome.[2]"
Coffin-Lowry syndrome,"No specific treatment for Coffin-Lowry exist. Proper management of patients with CLS, includes surveillance by performing regular hearing, dental, and vision tests; annual heart examinations; and periodic monitoring for kyphoscoliosis. Medications such as valproate, clonzapam or selective serotonin uptake inhibitors might be prescribed for drop episodes. Surgery may be performed for skeletal deformities.[2]AGeneReviews on Coffin-Lowry syndromehas been published and includes information regarding medical management and surveillance.

Cluster headache,"Treatment does not cure cluster headaches. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. Spontaneousremissionmay occur, or treatment may be required to prevent headaches.[1]There are medications available to lessen the pain of a cluster headache and suppress future attacks. Oxygen inhalation andtriptan drugs(such as those used to treat migraine) administered as a tablet, nasal spray, or injection can provide quick relief from acute cluster headache pain. Lidocaine nasal spray, which numbs the nose and nostrils, may also be effective.Ergotamineandcorticosteroidssuch asprednisoneanddexamethasonemay be prescribed to break the cluster cycle and then tapered off once headaches end.Verapamilmay be used preventively to decrease the frequency and pain level of attacks.Lithium,valproic acid, andtopiramateare sometimes also used preventively.[2]More detailed information on medications can be found in thetreatmentandmanagementsections of Medscape Reference's article on cluster headache."
"Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal dominant","Treatment consists primarily of surgery to reduce compression of cranial nerves and the brain stem/spinal cord at the level of the foramen magnum. Severely overgrown facial bones can be contoured; however, surgical procedures can be technically difficult and bone regrowth is common. Individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia should have regular neurologic evaluations, hearing assessments, and ophthalmologic examinations. The frequency of these evaluations and assessments should be determined by the individual's history and severity of skeletal changes.[2]"
"Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type","Treatment consists primarily of surgery to reduce compression of cranial nerves and the brain stem/spinal cord at the level of the foramen magnum. Severely overgrown facial bones can be contoured; however, surgical procedures can be technically difficult and bone regrowth is common. Individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia should have regular neurologic evaluations, hearing assessments, and ophthalmologic examinations. The frequency of these evaluations and assessments should be determined by the individual's history and severity of skeletal changes.[6]"
Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita,"Most patients with CMTC show gradual but definite improvement with age. The most noticeable change occurs during the first year of life. After this time, fading of the mottled skin pattern slows down, but continues as the skin matures and thickens. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. CMTC of the legs can be associated with early development of superficial venous insufficiency which may require treatment.Infants with a diagnosis of CMTC and associated abnormalities should be referred to a specialist.[3]"
Pili torti,"In acquired pili torti, treatment involves stopping the exposure to the causative agent (e.g., to oral retinoids) or condition (e.g., improving diet).[1]There is no specific treatment for theinheritedform of pili torti. It may improve spontaneously after puberty. If pili torti is detected, further evaluation to investigate possible neurological disorders, problems with hair, teeth or nails (ectodermal disturbances) andhearing lossis mandatory.[2]It is generally recommended that people with pili torti try to avoid trauma to the hair.[1][3]Suggestions include, sleeping on a satin pillowcase, avoiding excessive grooming, braiding, heat treatments, dying and coloring, reducing exposure to sunlight (wear a hat), using gentle shampoos diluted in warm water, adding conditioner to freshly washed hair, avoiding use of a hair dryer (or using it on cool setting), and avoiding oral retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin, acitretin) if possible.[3][1]Some individuals with pili torti choose to wear a wig.[1]"
Coats disease,"Treatment for Coats disease depends on the severity in each person.[1]The following treatments (used alone or in combination) may be tried:Laser photocoagulation(uses a laser to shrink or destroy blood vessels)Cryotherapy(a procedure that uses extreme cold to destroy abnormal blood vessels)Intravitreal corticosteroid injectionsto control inflammationAnti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injectionsMore advanced disease with extensive retinal detachment may also require  surgical interventions such asvitrectomy,scleral bucklingto correct a detached retina, and external drainage of fluids.[5]"
Coccygodynia,"Treatment for coccygodynia generally falls into conservative management or surgical intervention categories. The conservative approach typically includes hotsitz baths,NSAIDs,stool softeners, and/or the use of a donut-shaped pillow or gel cushion to descrease pressure and irritation of the coccyx. If these treatment options fails,glucocorticoid injectionsmay be used in an attempt to reduce the pain. Massage therapy has also been used to help decrease pain, but most studies have shown that the relief experienced from this form of therapy is temporary. The more aggressive and rare approach involves either partial or complete removal of the coccyx (coccygectomy).[1][3]"
Coffin-Siris syndrome,"People with Coffin-Sirissyndromemay benefit from occupational, physical, and speech therapy. Developmentalpediatriciansmay be helpful in recommending and coordinating therapeutic and educational interventions. Additional specialty care may be needed depending on the symptoms in the individual, such as by gastrointestinal, eye, kidney, heart, and hearing specialists.[2]"
Oculomotor apraxia Cogan type,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for COMA. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms. Specialists that may be involved in the care of an individual with COMA include anephrologist(kidney specialist),ophthalmologist(eye doctor),geneticist, andneurologist.[1][2]"
Cohen syndrome,"There is no cure for Cohensyndrome. Treatment is focused on improving or alleviating the signs and symptoms in the patient. Typically, when a person is first diagnosed with Cohen syndrome, he or she will undergo an eye and blood examination. If vision problems are detected, early correction of the problems, usually with glasses, often leads to general improvement of cognitive skills. If neutropenia (a condition in which an abnormally low number ofwhite blood cellscalled neutrophils are present, which may result in an increased risk for infections)  is discovered when the blood is examined, treatment should be given. Follow-up should include annual eye exams and repeat testing of white bloodcellcount. Early intervention and physical, occupational, and speech therapy can addressdevelopmental delay,hypotonia, joint hyperextensibility, and motor clumsiness.[2][3]"
Cold urticaria,"The treatment of cold urticaria generally consists of patient education, avoiding scenarios that may trigger a reaction (i.e. cold temperatures, cold water), and/or medications.Prophylactictreatment with high-doseantihistiminesmay be recommended when exposure to cold is expected and can not be avoided. Additionally, affected people are often told to carry anepinephrine autoinjectordue to the increased risk ofanaphylaxis.[2][1]Several other therapies have reportedly been used to treat cold urticaria with varying degrees of success. These include:[2][1]Leukotriene antagonistsCiclosporinSystemic corticosteroidsDapsoneOralantibioticsSynthetichormonesDanazol"
Collagenous colitis,"Treatment for collagenous colitis varies depending on the symptoms and severity in each affected individual. In some cases the condition may resolve on its own (spontaneousremission), although most people continue to have ongoing or occasional diarrhea.[1]Dietary changes are usually tried first to alleviate symptoms. These changes may include a reduced-fat diet, eliminating foods that contain caffeine and lactose, and avoiding over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or aspirin. If these changes alone are not enough, medications can be used to help control symptoms.[1]However, the response rate to various types of medication reportedly varies.[3]Prescription anti-inflammatory medications such asmesalamineandsulfasalazinemay help reduce swelling. Steroids includingbudesonideandprednisonecan be used reduce inflammation, but they are usually only used to control sudden attacks of diarrhea. Long-term use of steroids is typically avoided because of unwanted side effects. Anti-diarrheal medications such asbismuth subsalicylate,diphenoxylatewith atropine, andloperamidecan offer short-term relief. Immunosuppressive agents such asazathioprinehelp to reduce inflammation but are rarely needed. In extreme cases where the condition does not respond to medications, surgery to remove all or part of the colon may be necessary. However, surgery is rarely recommended.[1]"
Collagenous gastritis,"Because collagenous gastritis is very rare and its cause is unknown, there is currently no established standard therapy for the condition. Various therapies have been attempted with limited success. These have included anti-secretary agents,steroids, iron supplementation, and hypoallergenic diets. Several other therapies have also been tested. A few affected people have shown improvement of symptoms, but no randomized, controlled trials have been performed. More studies are needed to establish a standard treatment strategy.[3]"
Colloid cysts of third ventricle,"For symptomatic colloid cysts treatment often involves surgery. Ifhydrocephalusdevelops, aventriculoperitoneal shuntmay be necessary. Stereotactic aspiration of a cyst may be useful, although there is a high rate of recurrence. People with a small symptomless colloid cyst do not require treatment, but may receive regular follow-up and testing (e.g., neuroimaging studies).[1]"
Colpocephaly,"There is no definitive treatment for colpocephaly. Anticonvulsant medications are often prescribed to preventseizures, and doctors rely on exercise therapies and orthopedic appliances to reduce shrinkage or shortening of muscles.[1]"
Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria type cblF,"Treatment for methylmalonic aciduria with homocystinuria cbl f may involve a combination of vitamin B12 injections and dietary management such as a low-proteindiet and medical formula. The following fact sheet for parents prepared byScreening, Technology and Research in Genetics provides additional information on the treatment and management of methylmalonic aciduria with homocystinuria.http://www.newbornscreening.info/Parents/organicaciddisorders/MMA_HCU.html#4"
Ichthyosis vulgaris,"While there's no known cure for ichthyosis, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms. Medications may include:[3]Creams and ointments containingalpha hydroxy acidssuch as lactic acid and glycolic acid that help to control scaling of the skin and increase skin moisture.Retinoidsto reduce the production of skincells.Antibioticsto treat secondary infections."
Common variable immunodeficiency,"The main treatment for common variableimmunodeficiency(CVID) isIg replacement therapy, which stops the cycle of recurrent infections. Ig may be taken intravenously (through the vein) or subcutaneously (by injection). Adverse reactions to Ig must be monitored during therapy.Ig therapy is effective in most people, leading to less frequent infections and arthritic symptoms. However, gastrointestinal (digestive) symptoms have little improvement with IVIG. In some people wwith CVID and severeautoimmune disease,  steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs in addition to Ig therapy may be needed.[1]Detailed information about the management of CVID can be viewed on Medscape Reference's Web site."
Familial LCAT deficiency,"Although there is no cure forfamilialLCAT deficiency, there are ways to manage the signs and symptoms including:[3][5]Dialysisand kidney transplant as needed for individuals who developkidney failureCorneal transplantationfor individuals with corneal opacities and severely reduced visionDietary restriction of fat intakeExerciseMedications to lower cholesterol (statins)Blood pressure medications (angiotensin receptor blockers)"
Mevalonic aciduria,"Treatment of mevalonic aciduria remains a challenge.[3]There is no standard treatment that is effective in all patients, so it remains mainly supportive.[2]Treatment withsimvastatin(an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, theenzymethat catalyzes the formation of mevalonic acid), which has been used with guarded success in patients with HIDS, worsened the clinical status of two patients with mevalonic aciduria.[4]Anakinra, another medication used with some degree of success in HIDS patients, induced partialremissionin at least one patient with mevalonic aciduria, but not all patients respond to so favorably.[3]Reports of successful treatment of mevalonic aciduria throughallogenic bone marrow transplantationhave also surfaced. At this point, this therapy is investigational and potentially applicable to patients with mevalonic aciduria whose condition is resistant to therapy with anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., inhibitors of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1 beta).[4][5]The following articles provide additional details regarding treatment of mevalonic aciduria.Nevyjel M, Pontillo A, Calligaris L, Tommasini A, D'Osualdo A, Waterham HR, Granzotto M, Crovella S, Barbi E, Ventura A.Diagnostics and therapeutic insights in a severe case of mevalonate kinase deficiency.

Mitochondrial complex II deficiency,Treatment options for complex II deficiency may be similar to those for othermitochondrial disordersin general.[2]The United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation (UMDF) provides detailed information on treatment through their Web site at:http://www.umdf.org/site/pp.aspx?c=8qKOJ0MvF7LUG&b=7934635We strongly recommend that you discuss this information with a healthcare provider.
Cytochrome c oxidase deficiency,"There is currently no cure for cytochrome C oxidase (COX) deficiency. Management of all forms of COX deficiency generally focuses on the specific symptoms present in the affected individual and is largely supportive. The goals of treatment are to improve symptoms and slow progression of the disease; the effectiveness of treatment varies with each individual.[3][4]Treatment generally does not reverse any damage that has already occurred.[3]Prognosisvaries depending on the form of COX deficiency present.[4]Individuals with benign infantile mitochondrial myopathy may experience spontaneous recovery (although early diagnosis and intensive treatment is still needed until this point), while there may be rapid demise in individuals withLeigh syndrome.[4]It is often recommended that individuals withmitochondrial disorderssuch as COX deficiency avoid fasting. Dehydration due to vomiting or illness may be treated with intravenous fluid if the individual is not able to take fluids orally.Seizuresare typically controlled with anticonvulsants. Some affected individuals may benefit from physical, occupational, and speech therapies that are specifically tailored to their needs.[3]Dietary supplements including certain vitamins and cofactors have shown varying degrees of benefit in individual cases.[4]Individuals interested in specific management recommendations for themselves or relatives should speak with their healthcare providers."
Complex regional pain syndrome,"There is no known cure for complex regional painsyndrome(CRPS). Treatment includes a multidisciplinary approach with the aim of controlling pain symptoms. It has been suggested that when treatment is started within a few months of when symptoms begin, improvement orremissionmay be possible.[3]A combination of therapies is usually necessary including medications, physical and occupational therapy, interventional procedures, and psychosocial/behavioral management.Medications may include:Oral and topical pain relieversAntidepressants or anticonvulsants (which are sometimes used to treat pain)CorticosteroidsBone-loss medicationsSympathetic nerve-blocking medicationsIntravenous anesthetics (Ketamine)Intravenous immunoglobulinInterventional procedures may include:Trigger/tender point injectionsRegional sympathetic nerve blockSpinal cord stimulationEpiduralclonidineChemical or mechanicalsympathectomyOther therapies may include applying heat or cold; electrical nerve stimulation; andbiofeedback.[2][3]Psychosocial and behavioral aspects of CRPS should be addressed, and it has been suggested that people with chronic CRPS should have a thorough psychological evaluation. This may be followed bycognitive-behavioral pain management, including relaxation training with biofeedback.[5]Unfortunately, published research studies validating the efficacy of these treatment options are limited and no single drug or therapy (or combination) has shown consistent, long-lasting improvement.[2][3]For more information on treatment options for CRPS, view information from theReflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Association of America (RSDSA)."
Cone-rod dystrophy,"Currently, there is no treatment to stop a person with cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) from losing their vision. However, there may be treatment options that can help slow down the degenerative process, such as light avoidance and the use of low-vision aids. It is important that people with CRD receive support and resources to help them cope with the social and psychological impact of vision loss.[3]Possible future treatments for CRD may include:gene therapy,stem cell therapy, andretinal implants.[4][5]Many of these therapies are still being tested inanimal modelsof CRD.[6]Before being approved as a treatment that will be available outside of research, a therapy must be found to be both effective and safe in people with CRD through researchclinical trials."
Unilateral absence of a pulmonary artery,"Treatment options for unilateral absence of the pulmonary artery (UAPA), include observation (symptom-free, low risk cases), surgery to improve blood flow between the heart and lung (shunting or re-connecting existing arteries to the lung), surgery and/or medications to address lung complications, and embolization (blocking off) of dangerous blood vessels. Surgical approach is individually tailored based upon the person’s condition and anatomy. Early treatment (in infancy) can protect against late complications and improve lung development.[1][2][3][4]"
