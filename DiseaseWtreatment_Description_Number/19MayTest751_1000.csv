Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Goodpasture syndrome,"The treatment of choice isplasmapheresisin conjunction withprednisoneand cyclophosphamide. The three main goals for the treatment are:[1][2][3]Rapidly remove circulatingantibody, primarily by plasmapheresis.Stop further production of antibodies using immunosuppression with medications, namely,corticosteroids(e.g., prednisone) and cyclophosphamide. In children, plasmapheresis is done together with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. The duration of the immunosuppressive treatment varies but is typically 6 months for corticosteroids and 3 months for cyclophosphamide.Remove offending agents that may have initiated the antibody production.After hospital discharge, patients require long-term regular visits for monitoring kidney function and for immunosuppressive therapy. If kidney function does not return,dialysisis continued indefinitely and the patient should be referred for kidney transplantation.If the person smokes, it is recommended he or she stop. Also, if the patient is exposed to hydrocarbon in his or her occupation, he or she should consider changing jobs, as exposure to hydrocarbon has been shown to increase a person's chances of disease recurrence.[2]"
Antisynthetase syndrome,"Corticosteroidsare typically the first-line of treatment and may be required for several months or years. These medications are often given orally; however, in severe cases,intravenous methylprednisolonemay be prescribe initially. Immunosuppressive medications may also be recommended, especially in people with severe muscle weakness or symptomaticinterstitial lung disease.[1][3]According to recent studies,Rituximabis the medication option when patients with lung disease do not respond well to other treatments.[8]Physical therapyis often necessary to improve weakness, reduce further muscle wasting from disuse, and preventmuscle contractures.[1][3]"
Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy,"Anticonvulsant drugs, which are usually given to controlseizures, are ineffective in people with pyridoxine-dependentepilepsy. Instead, people with this type of seizure are medically treated with large daily doses of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin B6 found in food).[1][2]Recent studies have focused on using a lysine-restricted diet in addition to pyridoxine. Preliminary results suggest that this treatment has the potential to help control seizures and improve developmental outcomes in children with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy.[3]"
Hereditary antithrombin deficiency,"Once a patient with hereditary antithrombin deficiency develops a clot,anticoagulationtherapy (usuallyWarfarin) is often indicated. The duration of therapy after a first clot, especially in children, is a matter of some controversy, but therapy is generally continued for 3-6 months. Individuals who experience a second clot are at a significant risk for future clotting and are candidates for long-term Warfarin therapy. Asymptomatic individuals are often not treated with anticoagulation therapy. Should surgery be necessary, individuals with hereditary antithrombin deficiency may receive antithrombin III concentrate or fresh frozen plasma to boost antithrombin levels.[3]"
Bell's palsy,"Some cases of Bell's palsy are mild and do not require treatment.[1][3]In these cases, symptoms may subside on their own within 2 weeks.[3]For those cases that do require treatment, steroids such asprednisonehave been used with success to reduce inflammation and swelling.  Other  medications such asacyclovir--used to fight viral infections -- may shorten the course of the disease.Analgesicssuch as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen may relieve pain. Because of possible drug interactions, patients should always talk to their doctors before taking any over-the-counter medicines. Keeping the eye moist and protected from debris and injury is important. Other therapies such asphysical therapy, facial massage or acupuncture may also be used.[2][3]In general, decompression surgery for Bell's palsy is controversial and is seldom recommended.[3]"
Danon disease,"Treatment is aimed at addressing the symptoms present in each individual. This may require a team of specialists in addition to the primary care physician, including acardiologist,neurologist,ophthalmologist,geneticist,genetic counselor, rehabilitation physician, educational specialist, andphysical therapist. Because Danon disease can be associated with rapidly progressivecardiomyopathyand sudden death, careful monitoring of heart disease is required. Medications for heart disease may be a first line of treatment. Aggressive interventions may be recommended for people showing signs of progressive heart failure (e.g., early intervention with heart transplantation or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator). Assessment of muscle strength should be performed regularly.Physical therapymay help maintain muscle strength and flexibility. Males withintellectual disabilitiesshould receive appropriate educational interventions.[2]"
Townes-Brocks syndrome,"Treatment is directed towards the specific symptoms, including immediate surgical intervention for imperforate anus, surgery for severe malformations of the thumbs, and early treatment ofhearing loss. When heart defects are present, treatment is with theroutine management ofcongenitalheart defects, such as surgery and medication; Kidney impairment is treated withhemodialysisand, in some cases, with kidney transplantation forend-stage renal disease(ESRD). Regular monitoring of kidney function in individuals, with and without kidney anomalies, is recommended. An annual hearing testing is recommended.[2]"
Spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 2,"Although there is no cure for spinocerebellarataxiawith axonal neuropathy type 2 (SCAN2), treatments are available to help manage the signs and symptoms of the condition. For example, affected people may benefit fromphysical therapyand speech therapy. A wheelchair or other devices may be necessary to help maintain mobility. Children with SCAN2 may also need additional help in school since they may have difficulties with reading, writing and other activities. In some cases, a low-cholesterol diet may be recommended.[2][6]"
Takayasu arteritis,"The treatment of Takayasu arteritis is focused on controlling both theinflammatoryprocess andhypertension. Treatment options might include:corticosteroids,  medications that block the activity ofinterkeukin-6(iL-6 receptor inhibitors), medications that impair the activity ofB-lymphocyets(B-celldepletion), medications that are toxic tocells(cytotoxic agents), medications that block the activity oftumor necrosis factor(anti-tumornecrosis factor agents), andantihypertensiveagents. Lifestyle modification including exercise and diet might additionally be recommended.For additional information on the treatment of Takayasu arteritis, please reference theMedscape article. You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free."
Factor V Leiden thrombophilia,"Treatment of factor V Leiden thrombophilia varies depending on the patient's medical history and current circumstances.People with factor V Leiden thrombophilia who've had adeep venous thrombosis (DVT)orpulmonary embolism (PE)are usually treated with blood thinners, or anticoagulants (such as heparin and warfarin). Anticoagulants are given for varying amounts of time depending on the person's situation. It is not usually recommended that people with factor V Leiden be treated lifelong with anticoagulants if they have had only one DVT or PE, unless they have additional blood clotrisk factors.People who have factor V Leiden but have never had a blood clot are not routinely treated with an anticoagulant. In stead, they are counseled about reducing or eliminating other factors that add to their risk for clots. They may require temporary treatment with an anticoagulant during periods of particularly high risk, such as major surgery.[6]Women with factor V Leiden thrombophilia most often have normal pregnancies. Treatment with an anticoagulant during pregnancy and/or following delivery is often not needed, but may be recommended depending on the woman's personal and family health history, method of delivery, and other risk factors.[6][4]"
Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis,"The treatment or control of symptoms of autoimmuneprogesteronedermatitis (APD) varies. Mild cases might be successfully managed with use ofantihistaminesand/orcorticosteroids.Most methods of treatment focus on temporarily suppressingovulation. This might be achieved through varying medications including:conjugated estrogen,ethinyl estradiol,tamoxifen, anddanazol.Gonadotropin releasing hormoneagonists have additionally had reported success in the literature; however as these medications can prompt symptoms ofmenopause, they might not be recommended for pre-menopausal patients. Progesterone desensitization, in which increasing doses of progesterone are administered via vaginal suppository,  has been reported as a successful treatment in one case in the literature.For severe cases in which the above treatment options are not successful, surgical removal of ovaries oroophorectomyis curative.[3][5]"
Primary progressive aphasia,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Treatment is focused on slowing the progression of the disease and helping the person to adapt to the loss of language skills in everyday life. For example,speech therapymay be a helpful tool for people with PPA to maintain language skills for as long as possible.[1]Some people benefit from learning sign language or other ways to communicate.[3][7]Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) can be used to treat behavioral changes that may be associated with PPA. These medications may also help treat symptoms ofanxietyordepression, which can impact people who have PPA.[2]Clinical trialsare ongoing to try to determine more effective treatments for PPA.[8]"
Sutton disease 2,"Treatment may not be necessary for minor canker sores which tend to clear on their own over the course of a week or two. Large, persistent or unusually painful sores may require medical care.[3]The goals of treatment are to decrease pain, speed healing and avoid recurrence. While no one therapy meets all of these goals, many do offer some benefit.[4]Treatment may include mouth rinses, topical ointments or systemiccorticosteroids.[3]More detailed information about treatment options can be accessed through theTreatmentandMedicationsections of Medscape Reference and through theAmerican Academy of Oral Medicine."
Barraquer-Simons syndrome,"Surgery may be used to improve a person's appearance, but is not needed for medical reasons. Facial reconstruction techniques may be used with varying success. These techniques may include transplantation of fattissue, silicone implants, movement of facial muscles, or other techniques.No specific diet is recommended for people with Barraquer-Simonssyndromeand weight gain should be avoided. Regular exercise is recommended to improve a person's metabolic status.If a person with Barraquer-Simons syndrome has kidney problems, then they may also need to be managed. Treatment may involving a special diet or medications.Dialysisor a kidney transplant may be needed if the condition progresses to kidney failure.[2]"
Aplasia cutis congenita,"Treatment of aplasia cutis congenita varies depending on the condition of the infant. Conservative treatment is preferred.[5]Small areas usually heal on their own over time. Gentle cleansing and application of bland ointments orsilver sulfadiazinecan help prevent infection. If infection occurs,antibioticscan be used.[3][6]Recently, a variety of specialized dressing materials have been developed and used.[3]Larger lesions may require surgery.[3][6]Ultimately, the decision to use medical, surgical, or both forms of therapy  depends primarily on the size, depth, and location of the skin defect.[3]"
Epidermolysis bullosa,"Managing EB requires a multidisciplinary team of health care providers including adermatologist, EB nurse who specializes in wound care,occupational therapist,nutritionist, and social worker. Various other specialists may be consulted as needed. Management should be individualized for each person depending on their age, severity, symptoms, complications, and priorities.While there currently is no specific therapy for most forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), extensiveclinical research regarding potential treatmentsis ongoing. At this time, management is mostly supportive and involves wound care, pain control, controlling infections, nutritional support, and prevention and treatment of complications. Monitoring for complications with laboratory testing andimagingstudies is also important, although the frequency of these tests will vary depending on the type of EB and severity in each person. Newborns with EB should be taken care of in a neonatal or pediatric unit that has the expertise, staffing, and resources necessary to manage severe skin erosions and potential complications.More detailed information about the treatment and management of EB can be viewed here on Medscape Reference's website. You may need to register to view the information, but registration is free."
Limb-body wall complex,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for limb-body wall complex and it is generally considered to be incompatible with life (fatal).[1][2][3]"
Pseudocholinesterase deficiency,"People with known pseudocholinesterase deficiency should avoid exposure to sources of choline esters. Treatment of prolonged respiratory paralysis following surgery often involves mechanical ventilatory support until the paralysis resolves on its own. In most cases, recovery happens without the need for medical assistance.[4][2]"
Fox-Fordyce disease,"Individuals with Fox-Fordyce disease should consult with adermatologistregarding treatment.Some of the recent treatments for the FFD include:interlesional glucocorticoids,topical steroids, oralandtopical retinoids,topicalclindamycin, topicalpimecrolimus cream,benzoyl peroxide,oral antibioticsandcontraceptives orantiandrogenic hormonal therapy.[4][3]Pimecrolimusandtacrolimus, both with significant anti-inflammatory activity and low side-effects, have provided rapid improvement in a limited number of cases.[1]Other forms of treatment used areultraviolet radiation(phototherapy),dermabrasion,liposuctionandsurgical excision.[4]Immunosuppressants have been utilized with modest success.For individuals who do not respond to medications, destruction or removal of the apocrine sweat glands (glands that surround hair follicles) has been effective in some cases.[4]"
Jejunal atresia,Jejunal atresia is typically treated with surgery as soon as possible.Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)is generally necessary for a period of time following surgery until normal meals are tolerated.[3][2]
Aquagenic pruritus,It is difficult to find effective treatments for aquagenic pruritus because the underlying cause is poorly understood.[1][2][3]Therapies that have been attempted with varying success include:Antihistamines[9]Analgesics (pain relievers)[9]Opioid receptor antagonists[9]Alpha interferon 2b[9]Cholestyramine[9]Clonidine[9]Topicalcapsaicincream[10][2][9]Naltrexone[10]Adding sodium bicarbonate to bath water[2]Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors[2][9]UV therapy- shown to be effective in about 50% of patients[9]PUVA therapy[1]Propranolol[2][9]Atenolol[2]Using baby oil or other hydrophobicemollients(skin softeners that repel water) before and/or after showering[9][11]People with questions about the management of aquagenic pruritus should speak with their doctor about available treatment options.
Aquagenic urticaria,"Due to the rarity of the condition, there is very limited data regarding the effectiveness of individual treatments for aquagenic urticaria. The following have been used to treat aquagenic urticaria with variable success:[1]H1 antihistaminesPropranololUltraviolet B (UVB) light treatments (also called phototherapy)Stanozolol (ananabolic steroid)Creams that serve as a barrier between water and the skinA low dose of aselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in combination withcyproheptadineand methscopolamineBath with sodium bicarbonate (0.1–0.5 kg/bath).Please speak with your doctor if you have any questions about your personal treatment plan."
Hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius,"The treatment ofhydrocephalusdue tocongenitalstenosis of aqueduct of sylvius (HSAS) is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example,hydrocephalusis typically treated withshunt surgery. Special education andearly interventionmay be recommended for children withintellectual disability. Although intervention is rarely necessary for adducted thumbs (bent towards the palms),tendon transfer surgeryor splinting may be suggested in some cases.[1][2]"
Congenital contractural arachnodactyly,"Physical therapyfor jointcontractureshelps increase joint mobility and improve the effects of muscle hypoplasia (usually in the calf muscles). In severe cases, surgery may be needed. Since the kyphosis/scoliosistends to be progressive, bracing and/or surgical correction is often needed. Consultation with anorthopedistis encouraged. Other symptoms, if present, should be addressed as they arise. Regular physician visits should be scheduled to monitor symptom progression and development.[1]"
Arachnoid cysts,"Whether to treat all arachnoid cysts, as well as the method of treatment, has been a subject of controversy in the medical literature. The need for treatment depends mostly upon the location and size of the cyst, as well as whether symptoms are present. Some believe that treatment should be reserved for individuals with symptoms, while others believe that even asymptomatic cysts should be treated to avoid future complications.[6]In the past, doctors have placed shunts in the cyst in order to drain the fluid. However, now that specialized techniques and tools allow for minimally invasive surgery, more doctors are now opting to surgically remove the membranes of the cyst or open the cyst so its fluid can drain into the cerebrospinal fluid and be absorbed.[4]"
Arachnoiditis,"Arachnoiditis is difficult to treat. Management aims to relieve pain and improve symptoms that impair fuction. Treatment may involve pain management,physical therapy, and psychotherapy. Surgical intervention is controversial because it generally provides only short-term relief and may increase the formation of scartissue, making the condition worse.[1][2]"
Arginase deficiency,"The main goals in the treatment of arginase deficiency are to lower arginine levels and to prevent buildup ofammoniain the blood (hyperammonemia). People with arginase deficiency must be closely supervised by a medical team with experience treatingmetabolic disorders. They may need frequent blood tests to check  arginine levels.Because arginine is a building block ofprotein, people with arginase deficiency must follow a diet that is very low in protein. It is often recommended they eat the minimal amount of protein needed to maintain good health, which varies based on many factors including age and weight. Protein is found in high amounts in meat, fish, beans, dairy products, eggs and nuts. However, it also occurs in foods like pasta, fruit and vegetables. Under the guidance of a metabolicdietitian, people with arginase deficiency must closely monitor all the protein they eat. They are often advised to drink special formulas and/or buy medical foods in which the protein levels are tailored to fit their needs. People with arginase deficiency may also need to take certain medications (called nitrogen-scavenging drugs) to reduce their levels of arginine.[3][1]If people with arginase deficiency have episodes of hyperammonemia, they may be given intravenous (IV) fluids. During an episode of severe hyperammonemia, people with arginase deficiency are generally treated in the hospital. They may requiredialysis, nitrogen-scavenging medications, intravenous (IV) fluids, or other treatments. These treatments are given to quickly reduce blood ammonia levels and prevent brain damage.[3]"
Citrullinemia type I,"Untreated individuals with the severe form of citrullinemia type I have hyperammonemia (plasma ammonia concentration 1000-3000 µmol/L).[3]Without prompt intervention, hyperammonemia and the accumulation of other toxic metabolites result in swelling of the brain, breathing problems, increased or decreased muscle tone, muscle weakness, problems staying warm,seizures, loss of consciousness, and sometimes death.[3][4]Without treatment, most babies die within the first few weeks of life.[4]"
Scleromyxedema,"There is no standard treatment for scleromyxedema. The severe course of the disease requires very aggressive treatment, and long-term maintenance therapy is usually necessary. According to the literature, the use ofintravenous immunoglobilin (IVIG)may be successful and usually is used first; this type of treatment can have relatively long-term effects and few side effects. Because of this, it is currently considered by many the best treatment option.Plasmapheresisis effective as a short-term treatment but leads to relapses (recurrence of symptoms).[2]For those patients who cannot receive IVIG,thalidomideand systemic glucocorticoidsmay be used. When the patientswith severe disease do not have a good response, other interventions are required, such asautologous bone marrow transplantation,melphalan,orbortezomibwithdexamethasone.[1]"
Chiari malformation type 1,"Some individuals with Chiari malformation type 1 do not have symptoms and do not require treatment.[1]People who have mild symptoms, withoutsyringomyelia, can typically be treated conservatively. Mild neck pain and headaches can usually be treated with pain medications, muscle relaxants, and the occasional use of a soft collar.[4]People with more severe symptoms may need surgery.[4]Surgery is the only treatment available to correct functional disturbances or stop the progression of damage to thecentral nervous system.[1]The goals of surgical treatment are decompression of the point where the skull meets the spine (the cervicomedullary junction) and restoration of normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the region of the foramen magnum (the hole in the bottom of the skull where the spinal cord passes to connect to the brain).[4]Prognosisafter surgery for the condition is generally good and typically depends on the extent of neurological deficits that were present before the surgery. Most people have a reduction of symptoms and/or prolonged periods of relative stability. More than one surgery may be needed to treat the condition.[1][4]"
Chiari malformation type 2,"People with Chiari malformation type II are typically treated with surgery. Surgery may include closure of open neural tube defects shortly after birth, treatment forhydrocephalus(most often by use of a shunt), and posterior fossa decompression (creating more space for the cerebellum and relieving pressure on the spinal cord). Medical issues may involve management of neurogenic bowel and bladder, neonatal feeding difficulties, respiratory failure, and apnea.[3]As with any form of surgery, there are risks associated with surgery to treat Chiari malformations. Sometimes, surgery leads to no improvement or even worsening of symptoms.[4]For example, if nerve injury in the spinal canal has already occurred, surgery will not reverse the damage.[5]However, most people who have surgery have improvement of symptoms afterwards. Even if symptoms do not improve significantly, surgery might prevent existing symptoms from worsening.[4]"
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease,"Although a cure or treatment for the underlying genetic cause ofautosomal recessivepolycystickidney diseasedoes not exist, advancements have been made in showing improvement of liver and kidney disease inmouse modelsof the condition by disrupting the function of certaincellreceptors.[5]Medical management is currently symptomatic and involves supportive care. Mechanical ventilation may be used to treat the underdevelopment of the lungs and breathing issues caused by the kidneys that are enlarged due to the numerous cysts. When the kidneys are severely enlarged, one or both kidneys may be removed (nephrectomy).Dialysismay be required during the first days of life if the infant is producing little urine (oliguria) or no urine (anuria). Low levels of sodium (hyponatremia) may occur and is treated withdiuresisand/or sodium supplementation depending on the individual's specific levels.High blood pressure(hypertension) is treated with medication.Kidney failurerequiresdialysis, andkidney transplantationis another option. Poor eating and growth failure may be managed withgastrostomy tubes.Growth hormone therapymay be used to treat the growth failure and kidney insufficiency. Urinary tract infections are treated withantibiotics. Those with liver involvement may require shunt to treat the progressive high blood pressure and possiblyliver transplantation.[4]"
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome,"Treatment for superior mesenteric arterysyndrometypically focuses on addressing the underlying cause of the condition.[1]For example, symptoms often improve after lost weight is restored or a body cast is removed.[4]Nasogastric decompression (a tube passed through the nose into the stomach) and proper positioning after eating (such as lying in the left side or standing or sitting with a knee-to-chest position) may be recommended to alleviate symptoms.[1]In severe cases, intravenous (IV) nutritional support and/or a feeding tube may be needed to provide enough calories. Affected people can usually then be started on oral liquids, followed by slow and gradual introduction of small and frequent soft meals as tolerated. Then, regular solid foods may be introduced.Metoclopramidetreatment to avoid vomiting may be beneficial for some people.[1]Surgery may be needed if other treatment strategies do not work. However, other treatment options should usually be tried for at least 4-6 weeks before considering surgery.[1]Surgery options are:[3]Strong’s procedure:  Where the duodenum is re-positioned to the right of the superior mesenteric arteryGastrojejunostomy: Where the jejune (the part of the intestines that continues with the duodenum) is joined directly to the stomachDuodenojejunostomywith or without division or resection of the fourth part of the duodenum."
Giant cell arteritis,"Giantcellarteritis (GCA) is typically treated with high doses ofcorticosteroidsto reduce the inflammation in the arteries. Corticosteroids should be started promptly (perhaps even before the diagnosis is confirmed with abiopsy). If not treated, GCA may cause permanent vision loss or a stroke. The symptoms of GCA usually quickly disappear with treatment, but high doses of corticosteroids are typically maintained for 1 month. It is known that the treatment is working when the symptoms are gone and thesedimentation rate, also known as sed rate (a blood test that measures the level of inflammatory activity), is normal. The corticosteroid dose may gradually be reduced.[1]Other medicines may help to reduce the doses of corticosteroids.[2]The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of under the skin injection (subcutaneous) of tocilizumab (Brand name:Actemra) to treat adults with giant cell arteritis.[9]Remember that only your doctor can prescribe a medication, so please talk to your doctor to find out if this medication may be right for you."
Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita,"The treatment of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and the severity of the condition. Early in life,physical therapyto stretchcontracturescan improve the range of motion of affected joints and preventmuscle atrophy. Splits can also be used in combination with these stretching exercises. For most types of arthrogryposis, physical and occupational therapy have proven very beneficial in improving muscle strength and increasing the range of motion of affected joints.[3][1][2]Some patients, however, have persistent functional difficulties despite a rigorous physical therapy regimen. In these cases, surgery may be recommended to achieve better positioning and increase the range of motion in certain joints. Rarely, tendon transfers have been done to improve muscle function.[3][1][2]"
Trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome,"There is no one treatment for trismus-pseudocamptodactyly (TPS), however, there are various strategies that can be used to manage symptoms. Physical and/or occupational therapy may be helpful for individuals experiencing difficulties with walking and hand movement. Surgery may be performed to correct certain musculoskeletal symptoms.[4]There have been reported cases of improvement of mouth mobility following surgery andphysical therapy.[1][2][5][6]"
Kuskokwim disease,"Treatment for Kuskokwim disease depends on the nature and severity of signs and symptoms in each affected individual. There is currently no completely successful approach to treat arthrogryposis. The goals of treatment may include lower-limb alignment, establishing stability for ambulation (moving about) and improving upper-limb function for self-care.[2]Many individuals with Kuskokwim disease are treated with leg braces and/or surgery and eventually are able to walk upright.[1]"
Nail-patella syndrome,"After a diagnosis of nail-patellasyndrome, a person may be recommended to undergoscreeningfor health problems that are more common in people with the syndrome. This may include having regular blood pressure checks, urine tests to watch for the development of kidney problems, and examinations by a medical eye doctor (ophthalmologist) to check for signs ofglaucoma.[2]Symptoms of nail-patella syndrome affecting the knee and elbow (orthopedic problems) may be treated withphysical therapy, braces, splints, or surgeries. Before a person with nail-patella syndrome has surgery for orthopedic problems, anMRIis recommended to make sure the doctors understand the unique anatomy of the joint or body part. Other symptoms of the syndrome, such as glaucoma orhigh blood pressure(hypertension), can be treated with medications as the medical problem would in people who do not have the syndrome. In some cases, people with nail-patella syndrome may require akidney transplant.[2]It is recommended that people with the syndrome avoidnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)such as aspirin, due to their increased risk of kidney problems.[2]"
Camptodactyly arthropathy coxa vara pericarditis syndrome,At present there is no cure or specific treatment for camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditissyndrome(CACP). Treatment options such asphysical therapyandpain medicationfocus on relieving the symptoms of the disease. Hip joint replacement surgery may also be an option.[7]The medication for juvenile idiopathicarthritisis not helpful for those with CACP.[2][6]
Autism spectrum disorder,"Although there is currently no cure forautismspectrum disorder (ASD), available treatment programs significantly improve the outlook for most affected children. Treatment plans may include a combination of the following techniques, including:[1][2]Applied behavior analysis(ABA)MedicationsOccupational therapyPhysical therapySpeech-language therapyFor more information about the treatment and management of ASD please visit theMedlinePlusorMedscape Referencewebsites."
Kohler disease,"Kohler disease typically resolves over time with or without treatment. However, pain relievers, rest and avoidance of weight-bearing activities can help alleviate some of the symptoms. In some cases, a plaster walking cast and/or arch supports may also be recommended.[1][2]"
Aspergillosis,"If the infection is widespread or the person appears seriously ill, treatment is started immediately.[3]Voriconazole is currently first-line treatment for invasive aspergillosis and is usually given intravenously.[2][1]There are other antifungal drugs that can be used to treat invasive aspergillosis in patients who cannot take voriconazole or who have not responded to voriconazole. These include itraconazole, lipid amphotericin formulations, caspofungin, micafungin, and posaconazole. Whenever possible, immunosuppressive medications should be discontinued or decreased.[2][3]A fungus ball usually does not require treatment unless bleeding into the lungtissueis associated with the infection, then surgery is required. Antifungal agents do not help people with allergic aspergillosis. Allergic aspergillosis is treated withprednisonetaken by mouth.[1]"
Jeune syndrome,"The treatment of Jeunesyndromeis based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Most people with Jeune syndrome experience breathing difficulties that may become more severe over time due to multiple respiratory infections. In very severe cases,mechanical ventilationmay be necessary shortly after birth and surgical interventions (i.e. chests reconstruction) may be recommended. In those who are less severely affected, respiratory infections should be aggressively managed to prevent or delayrespiratory failure.[2][3]Dialysisandrenal transplantationmay be indicated for people with kidney problems.[2]Medscape Reference'sWeb site offers more specific information on the treatment and management of Jeune syndrome. Please click the link to access this resource."
Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis,"If phacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is not associated with systemic complications (e.g., Sturge-Webersyndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, eye conditions) it requires no treatment, however pulsed dye laser may improve the appearance of port wine stains and Q-switched laser the appearance of pigmentary nevus.[2]Medical treatment of PPV with systemic complications requires individualized plans and often assistance from a team of specialists (e.g., opthamologist,neurologist, and vascular specialist)."
Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency,"Treatment for AVED requires lifelong high dose supplementation of vitamin E. When treated early, some symptoms, such asataxiaand intellectual decline, can be reversed. In older patients, treatment may slow disease progression, but some symptoms remain.[2][3]Research indicates that if vitamin E treatment is initiated in presymptomatic individuals with twomutationsin theTTPAgene(e.g., younger sibs of an affected individual), the symptoms of AVED will not develop.[2]"
Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy,There is no cure for DRPLA; however there may be ways in which the signs and symptoms can be managed including:[2][3]Treatment ofseizureswith anti-epileptic drugsTreatment of psychiatric problems with appropriate psychotropic medicationsAdaptation of environment and care to the level ofdementiaAdaptation of educational programs for affected childrenA medication typically used to slow the progress ofamyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) calledriluzolemay also be useful in managingataxiain people with DRPLA.[3][4]
Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome,"There are no official treatment recommendations for OMS. Management may involve:Surgery,chemotherapy, and/or radiation: When there is atumorpresent, treatment such as surgery for tumor removal, chemotherapy, or radiation may be required.[2]In children, the removal of the neuroblastoma does not always improve neurologic symptoms. Some adults with paraneoplastic OMA do not have more neurologic symptoms with the removal pf the neuroblastoma or after its treatment.Corticosteroidsor ACTH (adrenocorticotrophichormone), human intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), or immunosuppressive agents such as immuran, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab. In many cases, a combination of medications leads to the best result.[2][3][5]Adults may be less likely to respond to immunological treatment compared with children.[5]Trazodone: Used to treat sleep problems and associated rage attacks."
Familial atrial fibrillation,"We are unaware of treatment recommendations specific tofamilialatrial fibrillation, but there is information available about treatment for atrial fibrillation in general.Treatment for atrial fibrillation depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms and may involve medications, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes. People who don't have symptoms or related heart problems may not need treatment. The main goals of treatment include:[3]Preventing blot clots and lowering risk of stroke. This may involve blood-thinning medications such as warfarin, dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin.Controlling the rate of contractions of the ventricles (rate control). This may involve medications to restore the heart rate to a normal level, such asbeta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis.Restoring a normal heart rhythm (rhythm control). This is typically for people who don't do well with rate control treatment, or for people who recently began having symptoms. Rhythm control may involve medications or procedures and is usually begun in a hospital for monitoring. Procedures may includecardioversion,catheter ablation, ormaze surgery.[3]"
Holt-Oram syndrome,"Depending on the severity of the bone and heart problems, treatment for Holt-Oramsyndromemay require a team of specialists includingpediatricians, surgeons,cardiologists,orthopedists, andgeneticists.[2]Treatment of wrist bone and other upper limb bone problems may include corrective or reconstructive surgery, the use of limb prosthetics, andphysicaloroccupational therapies. The goal of treatment is to help people with Holt-Oram syndrome have as much use of the upper limbs as possible.[4]These therapies may be most effective if they are started as soon as a person is diagnosed with Holt-Oram syndrome. In some cases, the changes in the way the bones formed in the wrist and upper limbs may not cause any problems or need any treatments. In these cases, the bone abnormalities may not even be noticed unless anx-rayis being performed for another reason (incidental finding).[2][4]People with mild heart defects orcardiac conductiondisease may not require any treatment. In other cases, cardiac conduction disease may be treated withantiarrhythmic medicationsor apacemakerto maintain a regular heart rate. Other heart abnormalities may be treated with surgery. The specific surgical procedure will depend on the location and severity of the heart defect.[2][4]People with heart defects may be at an increased risk for bacterial infection and inflammation of the lining of the heart’s chambers and valves (endocarditis).Antibioticsmay be prescribed before surgical procedures to reduce the risk for infection.[4]"
Degos disease,"Currently, there is not a targeted therapy for Degos disease that has been proven effective. Treatment of Degos disease has been attempted with antithrombotic agents, such asaspirinanddipyridamole.[2]These treatments were reported to be effective in some patients.[2][3]Other treatments that have been tried, but have shown inconsistent results, includeanticoagulantsand fibrinolytic agents (drugs to help break-up and dissolve clots),ticlopidine,pentoxifylline, prostaglandin E1, andinterferonalpha-2a. Treatment withintravenous immunoglobulinhas also been tried, but produced conflicting results.[3]Infliximabwas reported to be ineffective in one case.[3]Immunosuppressives such ascorticosteroidsmay worsen Degos disease.[3]For further information on your treatment options, we encourage you to discuss your questions and this information with your healthcare provider."
Atrophoderma of Pierini and Pasini,"No single treatment of atrophoderma of Pierini and Pasini is consistently effective. Therapies that have been tried include topicalcorticosteroids,antibiotics, andantimalarials. There have been reports of symptom improvement with the use ofhydroxychloroquine,potassium aminobenzoate, and improvement following surgical care using a Q-switched alexandrite laser, however these findings have not been confirmed by larger studies.[2]If a person with atrophoderma of Pierini and Pasini tests positive forB burgdorferiantibody, standard Lyme disease therapy is often recommended.Click hereto visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Lyme Disease Information Resource pages to learn more about Lyme disease therapy."
Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency,"In some cases, people affected by non-classiccongenitaladrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (NCAH) may not require any treatment. Many are asymptomatic throughout their lives, although symptoms may develop during puberty, after puberty, or post partum. If symptoms are present, a glucocorticoid calleddexamethasoneis often recommended. Dexamethasone can treat irregular menstruation, acne, and excess body hair (hirsutism).[1][2]"
Atypical Rett syndrome,"Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Medication may be needed for breathing irregularities, sleep disturbances (melatonin), agitation (risperidone), rigidity and motor difficulties (levodopa and carbidopa), and to controlseizures(antiepileptic drugs). Anti-reflux agents may also be required.[1]"
