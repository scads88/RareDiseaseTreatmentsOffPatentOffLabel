Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,"Currently, the best available therapy is reversal of the immune-deficient state. This can sometimes be accomplished by alteration ofchemotherapyor immunosuppression. In the case of HIV-associated PML, immediately beginning anti-retroviral therapy will benefit most individuals.[3]"
Leukoplakia,"For most people, removing the source of irritation is important and often causes the lesion to disappear.[2]For example, if tobacco use is thought to be the cause, stopping tobacco use usually clears the condition.[1]Dental causes such as rough teeth or fillings should be treated as soon as possible.[2]When this is not effective or if the lesions show early signs ofcancer, treatment may include removing the patches.[1]The lesion is usually removed in the health care provider's office using local anesthesia. Leukoplakia on the vulva is treated in the same way as oral lesions.[2]Recurrences are common, so follow-up visits with a physician are recommended.[1]"
Lewis-Sumner syndrome,"The treatment most commonly used for Lewis-Sumnersyndromeisintravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). This type of therapy uses a mixture ofantibodiesdelivered through an IV to help alleviate the symptoms of the disease, and is successful in 80% of cases. For individuals who do not respond to IVIg, treatment with subcutaneous immunoglobulins orplasma exchangehave proved effective.[5][6]Up to 40% of individuals who are not responsive to treatment eventually experience a reduction in symptoms.[7]"
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B).  Treatment options that may be recommended for people with LGMD1B may include:[1]Weight controlto avoidobesityPhysical therapyand stretching exercises to preventcontracturesof the elbowsUse of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, and wheelchairsMonitoring for evidence of heart problemsIn some cases, apacemakermay be necessary to treat heart problems associated with LGMD1B. It is recommended that people with LGMD1B be provided with social and emotional support to cope with the diagnosis. Other specialists that may be recommended include aneurologist,cardiologist,occupational therapist,nutritionist, andgenetic counselor.[1]"
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B). Treatment options that may be recommended for people with LGMD2B may include:[1]Weight controlto avoidobesityPhysical therapyand stretching exercisesUse of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, and wheelchairsIt is recommended that people with LGMD2B be provided with social and emotional support to cope with the diagnosis. Other specialists that may be recommended include aneurologist,occupational therapist,nutritionist, andgenetic counselor. No currently available medications can relieve or reverse the symptoms associated with LGMD2B. However, research is ongoing to try to determine if treatments such asgene therapymay be helpful in the future.[5]"
Lichen planus pigmentosus,"There is currently no consensus about treatment for lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP). Management includes avoiding things that make it worse in each case, such as  sun exposure or friction in body folds (via weight loss or wearing loose clothing).[5]No treatment options have shown consistent responses, and evidence of successful treatment has been limited to a few case series.[5]Treatment options may include:[1][4][6][7][8]Vitamin ATopicalcorticosteroidsTopical calcineurin inhibitorssuch astacrolimus(medications that are typically used to treat eczema)Dapsone(a medication used to treatleprosyand skin infections)Skin lightening agentsLaser therapyIn some cases, LPP goes away on its own within weeks. In other cases, pigmentation persists for years.[1][5]"
Lichen sclerosus,"Strongtopical steroidcreams or ointments reportedly are very helpful for lichen sclerosus, especially when it affects the genital areas. However, the response to this treatment varies. While itching may be relieved within days, it can take weeks or months for the skin's appearance to return to normal.Other treatments that may be used instead of steroid creams, or in combination with steroid creams, includecalcipotriol cream, topical and systemic retinoids (acitretin), and/or systemic steroids.If the vaginal opening has narrowed, dilators may be needed. In rare cases, surgery is necessary to allow for sexual intercourse. The condition sometimes causes the vaginal opening to narrow or close again after surgery is initially successful.[1]Additional information about treatment of lichen sclerosus can be viewed on Medscape's Web site."
Liddle syndrome,"Treatment for Liddlesyndromeconsists of following a low sodium diet and taking potassium-sparingdiuretics, which reduce blood pressure and correct hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Conventional anti-hypertensive therapies are not effective for this condition.[5][2]"
Limbic encephalitis,"Treatment for limbic encephalitis varies depending on the underlying cause. In cases of confirmed paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE), removal or treatment of thetumoris often the first step in treatment. If the cause of limbic encephalitis is a viral infection, an antiviral drug may be prescribed.Immunotherapyis often utilized as a first line or second line treatment.[6][2]If immunotherapy fails, medications such asrituximaborcyclophosphamidemay be considered.[2]"
Linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis,"There is very limited information regarding the treatment of linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis (LWNH). Chemical peels and2% hydroquinone(a skin lightening agent) for treatment of hyperpigmentation have been described. Due to the possible association withchromosome abnormalitiesand other symptoms, people with LWNH should be evaluated for developmental delays, growth delays, skeletal abnormalities, andcongenital heart defects.[3]"
Tardive dyskinesia,"The treatment for tardive dyskinesia varies from person to person. Initial treatment usually consists of discontinuing the use of neuroleptic medications if it is safe for the affected person. In people with severe psychiatric conditions, this may not be an option, although the neuroleptic drug can sometimes be replaced with an alternative medication.[1][2]Other medications can be prescribed to specifically treat the signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. In some affected people, these drugs help reduce the severity of involuntary movements. For example, a medication called tetrabenazine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Other drugs such as benzodiazepines,clozapine, orbotulinum toxin (Botox) injectionsalso may be tried.[1][3]"
Lipedema,"There is no one treatment for lipedema; however various strategies may be useful to manage symptoms. One such method iscomplete decongestive therapy (CDT). CDT is an intensive program that combines different treatment approaches such as bandaging, compression garments, manual lymphatic drainage (massage technique that aims to encourage drainage oflymph fluid), exercise, and self care. In a study of 38 women with lipedema, CDT was found to successfully reduce the rate of bruise formation.[1][4][6]Surgery is the only technique to remove abnormal fattissue; however its use is controversial. Surgery may damage the lymphatic vessels and should be undertaken only by surgeons with expertise in treating lipedema.[1][2][4]"
Liposarcoma,"The treatment for liposarcoma depends on the type, size, and location of thetumor.  Surgery to remove the tumor is often the first treatment.  When the tumor is in the abdomen, it may be difficult to remove completely, especially if the tumor is growing near importantorgansthat cannot be removed.  If the entire tumor cannot be removed during surgery,radiation therapymay be used after surgery to kill anycancercellsthat remain to reduce the chance of the tumor coming back (arecurrence).Chemotherapyis another treatment that can kill remaining cancer cells following surgery, though it is not usually used to treat low-grade sarcomas.[3][4]Sometimes radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be done prior to surgery to shrink the tumor; this may increase the chance of removing the whole tumor during surgery while limiting the impact to other organs.[3][4]"
Livedoid vasculopathy,"Treatment of livedoid vasculopathy aims to reduce pain, ulceration and scarring. General treatment measures may involve protecting the skin from injury and irritants, removing deadtissuefrom the ulcers, treating infection withantibiotics, elevating legs, compression therapy, and avoiding smoking and hormonal contraceptives.[1][2]Treatments will also be given to address any co-occurring conditions such as lupus or thrombophilia. Drugs that aim to improve blood flow or prevent blood clotting may also be considered. Examples of these treatments, include:[1][2]Antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, dipyridamole)Fibrinolytic agents (e.g. danazol, tissue plasminogen activator)Anticoagulant agents (e.g. subcutaneous heparin injections, oral warfarin)PentoxifyllineLow-dose danazol (200 mg/day orally)Hyperbaric oxygenPulsed intravenous immunoglobulinIloprostKetanserinPsoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapyNiacin (nicotinic acid)SulfapyridineGuanethidineCurrently there are no established guidelines for treatment. Decisions
for treatment are made based on the clinicians clinical experience and
specific patient characteristics. We strongly recommend that you discuss this information and your treatment options further with a trusted healthcare professional."
Unicentric Castleman disease,"Unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) can usually be cured by surgically removing the enlargedlymph node. If surgery isn't an option or the lymph node can not be removed completely,radiation therapymay be recommended to shrink and/or destroy the affectedtissue.[1][2][3]"
Localized hypertrophic neuropathy,"Because this condition is rare, there are no established guidelines for the treatment of localized hypertrophic neuropathy.  Treatment is determined based on each individual's symptoms and personal medical history.  Treatment usually consists of having surgery to remove the abnormal part of the nerve.  Some individuals do not have surgery and their symptoms are monitored over time.[1]"
Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris,"Although there is no cure for pustulosis palmaris et plantaris, various measures may be useful to manage symptoms. General suggestions include smoking cessation and emollients (non-cosmetic moisturizers) to soften dry skin and prevent cracking. Topicalcorticosteroids(steroids), an oral retinoid such asacitretin, andphotochemotherapy(ultraviolet radiationtreatment) are often first-line treatments.[1][2]Other methods that may be utilized when initial treatment options fail include a combination of oral retinoid and photochemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy with medications such ascyclosporine.[2]"
Logopenic progressive aphasia,"Although no medications or interventions have demonstrated long-term stabilization of logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), different treatment methods have shown promising short-term benefits.[2][4]Studies utilizing language therapy and behavioral interventions have shown encouraging results. Neuromodulation through methodologies such asTranscranial Direct Current Stimulation(tDCS) andtranscranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS) have additionally been identified as a promising therapies to potentially use in combination with behavioral treatment and language therapy.[2]As the most common underlying pathology of LPA is Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, limited research has been completed on interventions shown to reduce the rate of decline in cognitive symptoms in AD. So farcholinesterase inhibitorsandmemantine, medications used in Alzheimer’s disease, have not been proven effective in treating logopenic progressive aphasia. Case studies involvingsterioduse andOmentum Transposition Therapyhave reported improvement; however, the results have not been replicated in other cases and as with other treatment options, long-term studies are lacking.[2]The National Aphasia Association provides further information on the medical management ofprimary progressive aphasiasat the following link:http://live-naa.pantheon.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Managing-PPA.pdf"
Loin pain hematuria syndrome,"At this time, there is no disease-specific  treatment or cure for loin pain hematuriasyndrome(LPHS), since the cause of the disease is not understood. Unless the cause ofglomerular diseaseis treatable, the treatment of primary and secondary LPHS focuses on pain management.[1][2]People with LPHS may be told to avoid activities that increase or trigger their pain, such as exercise, riding in a car, or lying on their back. Pain management may include medications, such as non-opioid pain pills (analgesics),narcotics, oropioidsdepending on the severity of pain, and/or possibly anerve blockor transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Medications may also be used to treat nausea and vomiting if needed. If there is a history ofkidney stonesorbuild of calcium deposits, recommended treatment may include management of the amount of liquid a person drinks or changes in diet.[1][2]Limited evidence suggests that drugs thatinhibit angiotensinmay reduce the frequency and severity of episodes of loin pain and severe hematuria.[1][2]Similarly, one study in 2009 foundneuromodulationthrough implanted electrodes successfully reduced the pain in four women with LPHS, but it is unclear if neuromodulation has been tested further as a treatment for LPHS.[2][4]People with debilitating pain who do not respond to other therapies may be offered surgery, such as  renal denervation,nephrectomy, or kidney auto-transplantation; however, surgical treatment of LPHS is controversial as some studies suggest that it has limited value for treating the recurrent pain and the possible complications of the procedures may outweigh the benefits.[1][2]"
MECP2 duplication syndrome,"BecauseMECP2duplicationsyndromeaffects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this condition varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, infants with trouble swallowing and/or other feeding difficulties may require afeeding tube. Early developmental interventions may be recommended to help affected children reach their potential. This may includephysical therapy,speech therapyand/oroccupational therapy. Medications may be prescribed to treatseizuresorspasticity. Recurrent infections are usually treated aggressively with appropriateantibiotics.[1][2]Please speak with a healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan or that of a family member."
Nocardiosis,"Nocardiosis is typically treated with the use ofantibiotics. Because some Nocardia species are resistant to certain antibiotics, laboratory testing is needed to find out which species is causing the infection and to which antibiotic thesebacteriamay be susceptible. Treatment usually lasts for at least six months and may involve use of more than one antibiotic, but depending on the severity may last for about a year. Some abscesses or wound infections may need to be surgically drained.[1][4][2]The antibiotic known as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is considered the therapy of choice by most doctors. Other antibiotics include:[4][2][3]SulfonamidesCarbapenems (imipenem or meropenem, but not ertapenem)Third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), and amikacin, alone or in combination.Imipenem plus amikacin (which may be the chosen treatment for patients with sulfonamide-allergic patients)LinezolidTigecyclineCombination therapy with several antibioticsOther alternative oral treatment include minocycline and amoxicillin/clavulanate, in addition to linezolid.[4]"
Lymphatic malformations,"The best treatment options for lymphatic malformations (lymphangiomas) depend on many factors including the size and location of the mass; the type of mass; whether or not the mass is causing symptoms; and/or the affected person's tolerance of certain procedures.[1]Cystic hygromasand cavernous lymphangioma (bluish or red rubbery swellings under the skin) are often surgically removed; however, other procedures such as sclerotherapy (a solution is injected into the lymphatic malformation, causing it to shrink or collapse),laser therapyor radiofrequency ablation (a procedure where a needle is used to deliver a high-frequency alternating current that destroys abnormaltissue), may be tried depending on the size and location of the mass. Unfortunately, some of these masses may be difficult to remove and they often regrow after surgery.[1][3][4]Lymphangioma circumscriptum (clusters of small, firm blisters) usually require no treatment, although they can be removed withdermabrasionor laser therapy. Like other types of lymphatic malformations, they often recur after removal.[4]"
Yellow nail syndrome,"Yellow nailsyndromemanagement aims to address each of the symptoms. Treatment for nail discoloration may include oral vitamin E and/or triazole antifungals. Pleural effusion may be treated with surgery.Antibioticprophylaxismay be prescribed for bronchiectasia with chronic mucus production. Lymphedema treatment may involve low-stretch bandages and elastic compression garments combined with skin care, exercises and manuallymphdrainage as needed.[1]In some cases, yellow nail syndrome goes away on its own or when an underlying, associated condition is treated.[1]"
Mantle cell lymphoma,"Treatment of Mantlecelllymphoma (MCL) most often involves a combination ofchemotherapyandimmunotherapy. Additionally,hematopoietic stem cell transplantationmay be considered in some cases. Surgery is usually not helpful.[6]"
Lymphomatoid papulosis,"Localized mildly itchy skin lesions may be treated with mid- to high-potencytopical steroidsto hasten healing, or with more aggressive topical therapies (e.g.,phototherapy) to suppress the disease and the possibility of progression to lymphoma. Low-dose weeklymethotrexatehas been used to suppress the condition with some success, however the treatment effects are not lasting.Oral psoralen plus UVA phototherapymay also effectively treat and suppresses the disease.[2]A few reports have found that following treatments may also help with disease suppression:[2]Topical carmustineTopical nitrogen mustardTopical MTXTopical imiquimod creamIntralesionalinterferonLow-dose cyclophosphamideChlorambucilMedium-dose UVA-1 therapyExcimer laser therapyDapsone"
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,"For individuals who do not have any symptoms, doctors may decide to ""watch and wait"" and not treat the disease right away. This can last many years for some individuals. For individuals requiring treatment, the type and severity of symptoms present, aggressiveness of the disease, and age all play a role in the type of therapy chosen.[2][1]Some affected individuals have a procedure called plasmapheresis, to reverse or prevent the symptoms associated with the thickening of the blood (hyperviscosity). This involves removing the blood, passing it through a machine that removes the part of the blood with the IgMantibody, and returning the blood to the body. This may be combined with other treatments such as various types ofchemotherapy. Many different drugs can be used to manage this condition, both alone and/or in various combinations.For many individuals, there is a delayed response to treatment and the best response sometimes occurs several months after the treatment ends. Although the condition is not curable, many individuals do have a long-term response to treatment. Those who relapse after treatment or do not respond to initial treatment may consider secondary therapies. There are also several newdrugs and drug combinations that are being studied in clinical trials.[2]More detailed information about the specific medications used to treat Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia can be viewed on Medscape Reference's Web site."
X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 1,"X-linkedlymphoproliferativesyndrometreatment requires the coordinated effort of a team of specialists, such as apediatricianorinternist,immunologist,hematologist, andoncologist.[1]Because XLP can cause life-threatening conditions, it is important to identify males with XLP as soon as possible. Close monitoring (such as of EBV viral loads, IgG levels, blood counts, liver tests, inflammatorymarker, coagulation studies as needed) is a very important aspect of care.Treatment will vary depending on a variety of factors, including the severity of a person’s symptoms.[1][2]If a person is identified before EBV exposure, regular infusions with immunoglobulins (IgG replacement therapy) may be recommended to help prevent life-threatening infectious mononucleosis and the onset of other symptoms and findings potentially associated with XLP.[1]If a person with XLP is diagnosed after EBV exposure, treatment may include therapies to help prevent opportunistic infections associated with XLP, such asantibioticmedications, intravenous gammaglobulin therapy, and rituximab (to deplete B-cellsharboring EBV).[2][1]People with XLP are at risk forhemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis(HLH). HLH isa condition in which the body makes too many activatedimmune cells(macrophages andlymphocytes). Treatment of HLH may include a combination of strong immune suppressing medications followed by astem cell transplant.[1][3][2]Studies on new treatments for HLH have been completed in recent years (e.g., anti-thymocyte globulin), and others are underway (Toculizumab, Novimmune NI-0501, and Ruxolitinib).[3]It is hoped that new medications will improve success rates and long term outlook for people with HLH who undergo stem cell transplant.Bone marrow or stem cell transplant is currently the only definitive treatment for XLP1. A tailored discussion regarding the risks and benefits of transplant for each individual patient is critical.Some people with XLP have developed B-cell lymphoma. The lymphoma may be treated with surgery, radiation, and/orchemotherapy.Genetic counselingshould be offered to people with XLP and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.Studies investigating novel treatments, such as SLAM family inhibitors,geneediting, andgene therapy, have been underway.[2]Improvements in gene therapy techniques have resulted in better outcomes and less risk for adverse reactions. Gene therapyclinical trialsmay soon prove this approach to be a viable alternative to stem cell transplant.[2]"
Mycobacterium fortuitum,"The treatment for an infection withMycobacterium fortuitumdiffers depending on the area of the body affected. Treatment almost always includes prolonged use of at least twoantibiotics, such asamikacin,cefoxitin, andciprofloxacin. There are no guidelines regarding the length of time in which medication should be used; however, treatment usually lasts for several months and should continue until the signs and symptoms of infection have resolved.Other treatment depending on the area and cause of the infection may include surgery to remove damagedtissuefrom infected wounds and removal of implanted medical devices (such animplantable cardioverter defibrillator).[1]"
MOMO syndrome,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for MOMOsyndrome. Treatment options are based on the specific symptoms that each person has. Options may include special education in school, therapies to help children meet developmental milestones, and meeting with anutritionistto discuss methods to help affected individuals maintain a healthy weight. All people who are diagnosed with MOMO syndrome should be evaluated by anophthalmologistto see if there are any eye abnormalities.[2]"
Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis,"Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis is generally not serious and many cases do not require treatment. For those cases that do, oral antihistamines, topicalsteroids, and a photochemotherapy calledPUVAmay be used.[1]These treatments are aimed at reducing the symptoms of the condition and making patients more comfortable."
Mycobacterium Avium Complex,"Mycobacterium avium complex is associated with several different conditions including pulmonary MAC, which affects the lungs; disseminated MAC, which affects many different parts of the body; and MAC lymphadenitis, which causes swollenlymph nodes. The best treatment options vary by condition. Pulmonary MAC and disseminated MAC are usually treated with a combination ofantibioticsand/or antituberculosis medications. Care must be taken in choosing the appropriate combination of medications as some of the disease-causingbacteriacan be resistant to many types of antibiotics and antituberculosis drugs. Surgical treatment may be considered in people with a poor response to drug therapy, drug-resistant MAC or the presence of many condition-related complications if the infection only affects one lung and the procedure is thought to be well-tolerated.[2][5]Treatment of MAC lymphadenitis usually involves surgical removal of affected lymph nodes. Affected people may also be prescribed antibiotics depending on the severity of condition and their response to surgery.[2][5]"
Malakoplakia,"Treatment of malakoplakia typically involvesantibiotic therapyand/or surgery (removing lesions).Antibioticsthat concentrate inmacrophagesare associated with a high cure rate. Antibiotics directed againstE. coliin combination with surgery provides the best chance of curing the condition. In many cases, it is usually necessary to stop immunosuppressive drug therapy to effectively treat malakoplakia.Other medications that may be used in combination with antibiotics and surgery includebethanechol(used to stimulate the bladder) andascorbic acid(used for collagen synthesis andtissuerepair).[1]"
Ovarian carcinosarcoma,"Because ovarian carcinosarcoma is rare, there are no established treatment guidelines.  Treatment decisions are based on the unique features of each individual's diagnosis.[1]TheNational Comprehensive Cancer Network(NCCN), a group of physicians and researchers who strive to improvecancercare, recommends that women with ovarian carcinosarcoma be treated similarly to women with ovarian carcinoma (also calledepithelial ovarian cancer), which is the most common type of ovarian cancer.[4]Currently, treatment for ovarian carcinosarcoma usually begins with surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible.Chemotherapymay be used to destroy any cancercellsthat could be in the body after surgery.  Medications that containplatinum(such ascisplatinorcarboplatin) seem to be the most effective chemotherapies for ovarian carcinosarcoma.  Recent evidence suggests that another medication calledifosfamidemay increase the effectiveness of treatment when used in combination with platinum-based medications.[1][4]"
Myoepithelial carcinoma,"The treatment formetastaticmyoepithelial carcinoma usually begins with surgery to remove the maintumor.Radiation therapycan be used to reduce the chance that the tumor could return in the same location. There is limited evidence about the usefulness ofchemotherapyin treating myoepithelial carcinoma, and there are no standard treatment guidelines.[1]"
Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia,"Surgical removal of the PASH lesions has been performed in some individuals. A wide margin around the mass may be removed to prevent recurrence. Although PASH lesions often grow over time and may recur, they are neither associated with malignancy (cancer) nor considered to be premalignant (pre-cancerous).[3]According to the medical text, CONN's Current Therapy 2007, approximately 7 percent of people experience a recurrence of PASH.[4]"
Treacher Collins syndrome,"There is currently no cure for Treacher Collinssyndrome(TCS).[4]Treatment is tailored to the specific needs of each affected person. Ideally, treatment is managed by a multidisciplinary team of craniofacial specialists.Newborns may need special positioning ortracheostomyto manage the airway.Hearing lossmay be treated with bone conduction amplification, speech therapy, and/or educational intervention.[5]In many cases, craniofacial reconstruction is needed. Surgery may be performed to repaircleft palate, to reconstruct the jaw, or to repair other bones in the skull. The specific surgical procedures used and the age when surgery is performed depends on the severity of the abnormalities, overall health and personal preference.[4]There are some possible treatments that are being investigated. Researchers are looking for ways to inhibit aproteincalled p53, which helps the body to kill off unwantedcells.[4][5]In people with TCS, p53 is abnormally activated, leading to the loss of specific cells and ultimately causing features of TCS. It has been proposed that inhibiting the production of p53 (or blocking its activation) may help to treat affected people. However, more research is needed to determine if this type of treatment is effective and safe.[4]Researchers are also studying the use of stems cells found in fattissueto be used alongside surgery in people with TCS and other craniofacial disorders. Early studies have shown that surgical outcomes may be improved using thesestem cellsto help stimulate the regrowth of affected areas. However, this therapy is still experimental and controversial.[4][5]"
"Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis","Treatment options that have been successful in improving symptoms of this condition include: oral steroids (prednisoneor prednisolone), tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy andcimetidine.[9]"
