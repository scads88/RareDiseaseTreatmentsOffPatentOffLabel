Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,"The treatment is basically done by giving theenzymealpha-1 antitrypsin (intravenous infusion of purified, human AAT) to prevent the progression of lung disease, aiming to increase the level of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the blood. Skin problems usually get better when the enzyme is given. It is recommended to avoid smoking and drinking.Other treatments include:[2][10233] [10251]Bronchodilatorsand inhaled steroids can help open the airways and make breathing easierLung volume reduction surgeryLung transplantationfor patients with advanced emphysema due to severe AAT deficiencyLiver transplantationfor patients with severe liver disease. After a liver transplant the AAT deficiency is corrected, because normal donor liver produces and secretes normal AATAntibioticsif there are infections.It is also recommended:[2]Vaccination against hepatitis A and BPreventive vaccines against influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.Ongoing research for other treatments include:[2][10233][10251]Gene therapyto replace the abnormalgenewith a normalSERPINA1gene (gene therapy) in the livercellsNasal spray with alpha-1 antitrypsinSynthetic inhibitors of human neutrophil elastase (intravenously and orally) which theoretically could provide protection against lung damageAntioxidant therapy with vitamins A, C and E and N-acetylcysteine for the treatment of emphysemaMedications to increase blood levels of AAT and decrease liver damage (Rapamycin and carbamazepine).Treatment with purified alpha-1 antitrypsin is indicated only when individuals:[2][10233]Are older than 18 years of ageHave levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin in blood that are less than 11 micromoles / literHave pulmonary function tests (spirometer ) that show airway obstructionDo not smoke or have stopped smoking for at least the last 6 monthsAre willing to be treated at the hospitalDo not have immunoglobulin A deficiency (because the therapy with alpha-1 may contain traces of immunoglobulin type A (IgA), and patients with IgA deficiency may haveantibodiesagainst IgA)In some cases it is also done in people who have normal airflow but who have aCT scanthat shows emphysema in the lung.Patients with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency should havelung function testevery six to 12 months. Liver function should be evaluated periodically in people with two abnormal copies of the Zallele(PI * ZZ). In cases of liver disease, liverultrasoundshould be done every 6 to 12 months to monitor for fibrotic changes and livercancer(hepatocellular carcinoma).[2]"
Amyloidosis AA,"Inamyloidosis AA, the treatment depends on the underlying disease. It is important to control the chronic infection or inflammatory disease which is responsible for the amyloid. Both surgery and medication can be used to achieve successful treatment outcomes for patients.Medscape Reference provides current and comprehensive information on medical treatment options for amyloidosis AA based on the underlying inflammatory disease or infection. Please visit the link below. You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free.http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/335559-treatment#showallKidney transplant is an important option in patients with amyloidosis AA in which stable control of the underlying disease has been achieved. However, appropriate patient selection is strongly recommended due to a higher incidence of heart failure and infections in AA individuals.[3]Currently there is aclinical studyon the safety and effectiveness of the medication KIACTA in preventing decline of renal function in patients with amyloidosis AA.CLICK HEREto learn more about this study including the six study locations within the United States."
Triple A syndrome,"There is no cure for triple Asyndromeat this time; treatment typically focuses on managing individual signs and symptoms of the condition.Glucocorticoid deficiency in individuals with knownadrenal insufficiency(present with Addison disease) is typically treated by replacement ofglucocorticoids. This may be important for avoiding an adrenal crisis and allowing for normal growth in children. In adult individuals, as well as those who have difficulty with compliance, replacing hydrocortisone withprednisoneor dexamethasone is sometimes recommended. It is usually recommended that affected individuals wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace and carry the emergency medical information card supplied with it.Achalasia is typically managed with surgical correction. Individuals may be monitored for pulmonary complications (due to reflux and aspiration). Gastric acid reduction therapy in individuals with reflux after surgical intervention is usually recommended. The symptoms in individuals with achalasia may be improved partially with pneumatic dilatation (also called balloon dilation). For those who remain symptomatic after this, other surgeries may be recommended.Alacrima is typically managed by applying topical lubricants (such as artificial tears or ointments), and with punctal occlusion (a procedure used to close the tear ducts that drain tears from the eye). The symptoms of alacrima typically improve with punctal occlusion. However, this procedure is usually only done when therapy with topical lubricants is unsuccessful.[1]"
Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency,"There is currently no cure for aromatic L-amino aciddecarboxylase (AADC) deficiency. Different medications can be used to help treat the signs and symptoms of the disease. However, although certain combinations of medications may help some people, there is no proven strategy that relieves the symptoms of all people with this disease.[3]Whether or a not a treatment works may depend on the exact change in theDDCgeneand how much the AADCenzymeis functioning in the body.[5]Since thenervous systemin a child with AADC deficiency does not have enough of certainneurotransmitters, the goal of many of the treatments is to make certain as much of these neurotransmitters are available as possible.[4]Medication could include any one or combination of the following:[4]Dopamine receptor agonistsMonoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitorPyridoxine (Vitamin B6)Other treatments may depend on the symptoms of each individual. These treatment options include:[4]Anticholinergic agentsto treat movement disordersSeizure medicationGastrointestinal medicationsMelatoninto treat sleep disturbancesPhysical, occupational, and speech therapy may also be helpful in improving symptoms of the disease.[2][4]Gene therapytreatment for AADC deficiency seems promising in mice with the disease (animal models),[6]andclinical studiesin humans are currently taking place to learn more about if the treatment is effective and safe."
Tangier disease,"To our knowledge there is no specific treatment for Tangier disease. Drugs known to increase high density lipoprotein levels in unaffected people, such as estrogens, nicotinic acid, statins, or phenytoin, do not work in people with Tangier disease.[2]To reduce the risk for heart and blood vessel disease, people with this condition should maintain a low fat (especially saturated fat) diet and overall healthy lifestyle. Heart diseaserisk factorssuch as smoking,high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, high level of triglycerides and homocysteine in the blood should receive prompt treatment. Fibrates can be used to help lower triglycerides.[2]To date, no treatment has been found to prevent the progression of this disease, including trials of omega-3-fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamin E.[2]Individuals with Tangier disease may benefit from referral to specialized lipid centers for advanced management. Consultation with the following specialists may be required:[3]LipidologistEndocrinologistCardiologistVascular specialistCardiovascular surgeonDietitian"
Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis,"Attenuatedfamilialadenomatous polyposis (AFAP) is generally managed with regularscreeningto detect if and when polyps develop.[2]Screening bycolonoscopyhas been recommended for affected people starting at age 20 to 25 years. People with polyps may undergo polypectomy (removal of polyps) followed by continued screenings every one to three years, depending on the number of polyps.[1]Aprophylacticcolectomy(removal of all or part of the colon) may be considered in people with too many adenomas to remove or those who cannot undergo screening.[3]About one third of people with AFAP have few enough colon polyps that screening with periodic polypectomy is sufficient.[1]Because individuals with AFAP can also developduodenaladenomas and othercancers,upper endoscopyis typically recommended starting at age 20 to 30 years and then every one to three years, depending on the number of polyps. There is currently no consensus on screening fortumorsthat occur outside of the colon, so it has been suggested that affected individuals are managed as if they have classic FAP.[3]A number of drugs such ascelecoxibandsulindacreportedly have been successful at reducing the number and the size of polyps in affected people, but these drugs generally help to prevent further complications and are not considered adequate treatment.[2]Additional and more detailed information about the treatment and management of FAP, including AFAP, is available on eMedicine's Web site and can be viewed by clickinghere."
Diamond-Blackfan anemia,"Some people have such mild signs and symptoms that they do not require treatment. In people who require treatment it may include:[3]Corticosteroids: Corticosteroid treatment is recommended in children over 1 year of age; this treatment can initially improve the red blood count in approximately 80% of people with Diamond-Blackfananemia.Prednisoneinitial dose is 2 mg / kg / day given orally once a day, at morning time.  After a month, if there is no improvment after a month the corticosteroids are tapered-of and suspendedBlood transfusions, which are given along with the corticosteroids or in people who do not get better with corticosteroidsBone marrow/stem celltransplantation: It is the only curative treatment for the anemia; however, patients should continue to be followed because they are at increased risk for leukemia andcancer. Results are better for children younger than ten years of age if transplanted using anHuman Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched sib"
