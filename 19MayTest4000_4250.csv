Disease Name,Current Standard of Treatment if Listed on NIH Rare Diseases Website
Polyembryoma,"Because polyembryomas are quite rare, there are no established guidelines for treating this condition.  However, the first step for treating a polyembryoma is often surgery to remove as much of thetumoras possible.Chemotherapy, and sometimesradiation therapy, have also been used after surgery to destroy anycancercellsthat may remain.[2][3]"
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,"The treatment for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) usually includes a combination of multiple medications. These medications typically include:[2]Glucocorticoidssuch asprednisoneImmunosuppressive drugssuch as rituximabIf there are skin lesions present, they may be treated with a topicalsteroidthat is applied to the affected area.[5]Surgery may be recommended if swelling of the airway or lungs is preventing normal breathing.[2]Other medications may be recommended to help treat GPA. These medications are often used to treat the side-effects that may be associated with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs and may include:[2]Bisphosphonateto prevent bone weakening that can be caused by prednisoneAntibioticsto prevent lung infectionsMedscape Referencealso provides information about the treatment of GPA, including a section detailing alternative and/or promising therapies."
Gray platelet syndrome,"There is no specific treatment for GPS, but management involves anticipating and preventing risks of bleeding (e.g. possibleplatelettransfusions before surgery). Treatment may also include administration ofdesmopressin.Splenectomyshould be considered to increase the platelet counts in those whose platelet counts decrease to approximately 30,000/microliter.Prognosisis generally good early in life whenthrombocytopeniais mild. Those with platelets counts less than 30,000/microliter are at risk for life-threatening bleeding.[1]"
Granuloma annulare,"If the rash is not itchy or causing bothersome symptoms, then it usually does not need to be treated.[3]The localized form of granuloma annulare may be treated with topical steroid creams, topicaltacrolimus or pimecrolimus, cryotherapy (freezing of the lesions), or laser therapy.[3]The generalized form of granuloma annulare can be more difficult to treat and many treatment options have been tried. There is little information on which treatments are best because none have been studied in largeclinical trials. The first treatments are usually topical steroid creams or steroid injections into the lesions. These treatments work best when the condition isn't widespread. Light therapy, also called phototherapy, is another treatment option and involves exposing the skin to ultraviolet light. It may includeUVA1 phototherapy,PUVA photochemotherapy, orphotodynamic therapy.[4]Other medications that may be given for generalized granuloma annulare includehydroxychloroquine,isotretinoin, ordapsone. Combinations of certainantibiotics(rifampin,ofloxacin, andminocycline) have been shown to be successful in some cases. For people with very severe disease, treatment options may includecyclosporine,infliximab, oradalimumab.[4][3]Many of these treatments have shown results in only a few patients and can have side effects. The risks and benefits of each treatment option should be discussed with your doctor."
Primary angiitis of the central nervous system,"The current treatment recommendation is to start with oralprednisoneat a dose of 1 mg/kg per day andcyclophosphamideat a dose of 2 mg/kg per day. Most centers use prednisone and cyclophosphamide for 4-6 months to induce clinicalremission, and then taper prednisone off.[1]Patients generally stay on cyclophosphamide therapy between three and six months, depending on when remission occurs and if there are any potential side effects from cyclophosphamide. Once cyclophosphamide is discontinued, it should be replaced with a less toxic medication for an additional six to twelve months of maintenance therapy. Some doctors switch from cyclophosphamide toazathioprine(2 mg/kg) ormycophenolatemofetil.Methotrexatecan also be used, but may be limited by its difficulty to cross the blood brain barrier. There is limited data on how long the maintenance therapy lasts so the decision on the duration of the therapy should be individualized, based upon how the patient responds to therapy.[3]"
Granulomatous rosacea,"As with other types or rosacea, patients with granulomatous rosacea are advised to avoid known exacerbating factors such as hot drinks, alcohol, and extremes of temperature. In  addition, they should be encouraged to use a noncomedogenic high-factor sunscreen when exposed to sunlight and wind.[1]Treatment of granulomatous rosacea is not different from classical rosacea andtetracycline,doxycycline,erythromycinorminocyclineare usually effective.[1][2]In addition,topical metronidazolemay be helpful for mild disease and in addition to systemic therapy. Topical keratolytics such asbenzoyl peroxideandazelaic acidoffer limited symptomatic control of inflammatory pustules.Isotretinoin(Accutane) may be helpful for recalcitrant (hard to treat) disease, but recurrence is common. Long-term, low-dose isotretinoin therapy may be suitable for some patients.Dapsonehas a pharmacological double function as both anantibioticand an anti-inflammatory drug. The value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea, however, has not yet been established by controlled studies. Permanent telangiectasia may be treated by electrosurgery or by pulsed dye laser.[1]More in-depth information about the treatment of rosacea, including granulomatous rosacea, can be found on theeMedicineweb page."
Gray zone lymphoma,"Gray zone lymphoma shares features with two other types of lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and mediastinal large B-celllymphoma (MLBCL).  Because MLBCL and cHL are treated differently, it is unclear how gray zone lymphoma should be treated.  At this time, there are no guidelines for the best treatment of gray zone lymphoma; treatment is determined based on each individual's diagnosis.  Treatment usually begins withchemotherapy, which may be followed byradiation therapyin some cases.[1]"
Griscelli syndrome type 2,"Bone marrow transplantationis the most effective treatment and the only possible cure for Griscellisyndrometype 2 (GS2).Immunosuppressive therapiesmay be used in preparation for transplantation, and to suppress damage to multipleorganscaused byhemophagocytic lymphohistiocystosis. Recurrent infections may be minimized with antibacterial and antiviral medications. In addition, avoiding interactions that increase the risk of infection is important.[3]Additional information about various medications used to treat GS2 can be viewed on Medscape Reference's website here."
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for pseudoxanthoma elasticum.  Affected individuals are recommended to have regular physical examinations with their primary care physician and routine eye examinations with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) who is familiar with retinal disorders.  A team of doctors in other specialties - includingdermatology,cardiology,plastic surgery,vascularsurgery,genetics, andnutrition- may also help with the management this condition.  Individuals should be alert to changes in their vision and should inform their eye doctor of any such changes.  Several therapies may be effective for slowing the reduction in vision in PXE.  Surgery may help to reduce skin symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, or severe vascular symptoms in the legs.[1]"
Grover's disease,"There is no cure for Grover's disease and treatment is usually based on a person's symptoms. Affected individuals are usually advised to avoid strenuous exercise and excessive sun exposure, as sweating and heat may induce more itchy spots. Initial treatment options includetopical steroid creamssuch as hydrocortisone, anti-itch lotions containing menthol or camphor, andcalcipotriolcream. For more severe cases, options includetetracycline,isotretinoin, antifungal pills such asitraconazole,PUVA phototherapy, and cortisone (steroid) injections. These treatments have important side effects and may not be necessary for mild cases.[1][2][3]"
Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly,"Individualized treatment of craniofacial features is managed by a multidisciplinary team which may include various specialists. Surgery may be needed for a variety of abnormalities, in the newborn period or beyond. Treatment ofhearing lossis individualized, and may involve conventional hearing aids, bone-anchored hearing aid, and/or cochlear implants. Occupational, physical, and/or speech/language therapies are involved as needed to optimize developmental outcome.[2]Additional treatment information is available on GeneReviews' Web site."
Laron syndrome,"There is currently no cure for Laronsyndrome. Treatment is primarily focused on improving growth.[4]The only specific treatment available for this condition issubcutaneous injectionsof insulin-like growth factor 1 (a growth-promotinghormone), often called IGF-1. IGF-1 stimulates linear growth (height) and also improves brain growth and metabolic abnormalities caused by long-term IGF-1 deficiency. It has also been shown to raise blood glucose levels, reduce cholesterol, and increase muscle growth.[3]IGF-1 and GH levels should be closely monitored in people undergoing this treatment because overdosage of IGF-I causes a variety of health problems.[5]"
Guttate psoriasis,"The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms and preventsecondary infections.[1]Mild cases of guttate psoriasis are usually treated at home. The following may be recommended:[1]Cortisone (anti-itch and anti-inflammatory) creamDandruffshampoos (over-the-counter or prescription)Lotions that contain coal tarMoisturizersPrescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids)People with very severe guttate psoriasis may take medicines to suppress the body'simmune system. These medicines includecorticosteroids,cyclosporine, andmethotrexate.[1]Sunlight may help some symptoms go away. Care should be taken to avoid sunburn. Some people may choose to have phototherapy. Phototherapy is a medical procedure in which the skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. Phototherapy may be given alone or after taking a drug that makes the skin more sensitive to light.[1]More detailed information related to the treatment of psoriasis can be accessed throughMedscape Reference. TheNational Psoriasis Foundationcan also provide you with information on treatment."
Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum,"Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC). However, quality of life may be improved with management of individual symptoms of the condition, which may involve:Medications andphysical therapyforspasticity(e.g.baclofen,diazepamor intramuscular botulinumtoxin)Medications fordystonia(e.g.trihexyphenidyl,tetrabenazine, or high doses oflevodopa and carbidopawhich were reportedly helpful in case reports)Gastrostomyfor feeding for swallowing dysfunctionRoutine treatment forseizures, constipation, and gastroesophageal reflux diseaseRoutine evaluations of swallowing and feeding, nutrition, orthopedic and joint integrity, and neurologic symptoms are recommended.[1]"
Trichotillomania,"Behavioral treatment seems to be the most powerful treatment for trichotillomania. Parental involvement is important and should include enough support so that affected children grow well intellectually, physically, and socially. Shaving or clipping hair close to the scalp may be helpful to stop the behavior.[4]Professionalcognitive behavior therapy(CBT) is recommended if initial approaches are unsuccessful. CBT typically involves self monitoring (keeping records of the behavior); habit-reversal training; and stimulus control (organizing the environment). CBT is typically effective in highly motivated and compliant patients. The success of therapy may depend on firm understanding of the illness and the cooperation of the family members to help the affected individual comply with treatment. Several courses of CBT may be needed.[4]No medication has been approved for the treatment of trichotillomania, and medications used have not been consistently effective.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitorshave been utilized but responses to treatment have not been consistent. Fortunately, severalrecent studies regarding drug therapy for trichotillomaniashow promise. While drug therapy alone is currently generally not effective, combination therapy and other treatments may be helpful.[4]More detailed information about current treatment options for trichotillomania is available on Medscape Reference's Web site and can be viewed byclicking here.

Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration,"The treatment of patients with PKAN is mostly symptomatic, and may include:[2][5][3][4][6]Medication: The tremors best respond todopaminergic agents. Benzodiazepines are used to improve muscular contraction and twisting and writhing movements.Dystoniais treated withoral trihexyphenidyl, oralbaclofenor a baclofen pump, and oral clonazepam.    Intramuscularbotulinum toxinis used for muscle spasms,especially in treating a limited body region (injections in the facial muscles can greatly improve speech and eating abilities). Methscopolamine bromide can be used for excessive drooling.Surgical procedures: Procedures to destroy specific parts of the brain, the pallidus (ablative pallidotomy) or the thalamus (thalmotomy) may provide temporary relief for dystonia.Deep brain stimulation: A procedure where a medical device called a brain pacemaker  is implanted to send electric impulses to specific parts of the brain  for the treatment of movement andmood disorders.Services for the blind and educational programs.Physical therapyand occupational therapy to maintain normal joint mobilityAdaptive aids (walker, wheelchair) for gait abnormalities.Speech therapy and/or communication devices.Drugs that reduce the levels of iron in the body (iron chelation) may be effective in some cases but more studies are needed. Supplements of vitamin B5 (pantothenate) may be helpful in people with the atypical PKAN but there are not enough studies confirming that it is effective.[6]A recent study with one patient using a medication known asfosmetpantotenate, which restores the CoA levels (a helpermolecule, needed for the activation of severalenzymes) decreased in this disease, showed good results.[4]"
HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis,"Treatment generally aims to control the specific symptoms, as there is no standard treatment available.[2]Interferon alphamay be beneficial over short periods, and some aspects of the disease may be improved withinterferon beta.[3]Stiff and spastic muscles may be treated withlioresalortizanidine, and urinary dysfunction may be treated withoxybutynin.[3]Corticosteroidswere reported to slow progression in one case series and reduce neurologic disability in another. However, others have reported no such benefit with corticosteroids and there have been no randomizedclinical trials.[1]"
"Hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps syndrome","In order to know how HANACsyndromeis affecting you, your doctor may recommend that you undergo a series ofimagingtests of the brain and kidney, an eye exam, and blood tests (e.g.,
serum CK concentration).[1]While there is not a targeted treatment for
HANAC syndrome, treatments are available to manage its signs and
symptoms, such as drugs to reducehigh blood pressure, manage
headaches, and treat arrhythmia. People with HANAC
syndrome may be regularly monitored (e.g., once a year) for signs and symptoms.[1]In order to reduce the risk for health complications, your doctor may advise you to avoid smoking, activities that can cause head trauma, and blood thinners (anticoagulants).[1]"
Harlequin syndrome,"If an underlying cause of Harlequinsyndromeis identified, treatment should be directed to the cause of the syndrome. Surgery may be possible to repair a lesion that is causing Harlequin syndrome. If there is no known cause of the symptoms and the symptoms are not affecting a person’s daily life, some people may choose not to pursue any treatment.[6]In cases where an individual has symptoms of Harlequin syndrome and wishes to receive treatment, injection withbotulinum toxin(Botox) or a procedure called contralateral sympathectomy is possible.[5][8][9]In contralateral sympathectomy, the nerve bundles that are responsible for causing flushing in the face are interrupted. Therefore, this procedure causes both sides of the face to no longer flush or sweat. Because the symptoms of Harlequin syndrome are not typically associated with affecting a person’s daily life, this treatment is only recommended if a person is very uncomfortable with the flushing and sweating associated with the syndrome.[9]"
Hashimoto's encephalitis,"Medical management of Hashimoto's encephalitis (HE) usually involvescorticosteroidsand treatment of thyroid abnormalities (if present). The optimal dose of oral steroids is not known. Most patients with HE respond to steroid therapy. Symptoms typically improve or resolve over a few months. Decisions regarding the length of steroid treatment and the rate of tapering off steroids are based on the individual's response to treatment. Treatment may last as long as two years in some patients.[4]People with HE who experience repeated HE relapses, do not respond to steroids, and/or cannot tolerate steroid treatment have been treated with other immunosuppressive medications such asazathioprineandcyclophosphamide.Intravenous immunoglobulin, andplasmapheresishave also been used.[4]"
Sickle beta thalassemia,"Treatment for sickle beta thalassemia is supportive and usually depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person. It is generally recommended that all affected people drink plenty of water; avoid climate extremes, activities that lead to inflammation and extreme fatigue; and stay up-to-date on allimmunizations. Because sickle beta thalassemia is associated with a variety of health problems, affected people are usually followed closely by their healthcare provider with regularphysical examinationsthat may include specializedlaboratory testsandimagingstudies (i.e.chest X-ray,transcranial doppler ultrasound,ECG). Blood transfusions may be prescribed on a regular basis for affected people with a history of orrisk factorsfor stroke and other specific health problems, such aspulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea, a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of sicklecelldisease, can decrease the frequency and severity of pain episodes; reduce the need of blood transfusions; and increase life span.[1][3]For more information regarding the treatment of sickle beta thalassemia and other sickle cell diseases, pleaseclick here."
Hemoglobin Zurich,"The most important aspect of management for hemoglobin (Hb) Zurich is to avoid
agents that might triggerhemolytic anemia. Mild hemolyticanemiamay not need treatment, as long as the
condition doesn't worsen. Treatments for severe hemolytic anemia include blood transfusions, medicines, and plasmapheresis.Click hereto visit the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to learn more about treatment."
Hypochondroplasia,"Treatment depends on the symptoms seen in each child. In some cases, stature is almost normal when compared with the stature of other family members. When necessary, treatment may include:[2]Developmental intervention and special education for learning disabilitiesA surgery calledlaminectomyor a procedure known as decompression which can take pressure off the spinal nerves or spinal canal in cases ofspinal stenosis(narrowing of the spine)Growth hormone therapyat around the time of puberty (this has shown mixed results)Support groups can help individuals with hypochondroplasia and their family members adapt toshort staturethrough peer support. They can also offer information on employment, education, disability rights, adoption of children of short stature, medical issues, suitable clothing, adaptive devices, and parenting through local meetings, workshops and seminars.[2]Please seethe contact information for  support groups for hypochondroplasia.Sometimes, children with hypochondroplasia  are more severely affected, and have very similar features to those ofachondroplasia. In these cases,recommendations for the management of achondroplasia(outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Genetics) may be considered. See alsoa description of the management of achondroplasia.[2]A consultation with a genetic doctor forgenetic counselingis also recommended so that there can be discussion of issues such as risk of recurrence and  parental concerns related to short stature."
Huntington disease,"Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for Huntington disease (HD). The current goal of treatment is to slow down the course of the disease and help affected people function for as long and as comfortably as possible.[3]Current treatment strategies involve the use of various medications to treat specific symptoms such as abnormal movements and behaviors. Depression and suicide are more common among affected people, so caregivers should monitor for associated symptoms and seek help if necessary. As symptoms of the disease worsen, affected people need more assistance, supervision, and care.[3]"
Hemangioblastoma,"Surgery is considered the standard treatment for hemangioblastoma and usually cures this condition.[2]Following surgery, individuals who have had a hemangioblastoma should continue to visit their physician regularly for physical examinations andmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)of the brain.[2][4]These suggested guidelines for follow-up after hemangioblastoma do not state how frequently physician visits orMRIsshould be."
Hemangioendothelioma,"Treatment for hemangioendothelioma may depend on the type of hemangioendothelioma present in the affected individual and the risk of recurrence or metastases. In most reported cases, surgical excision (removal) of the mass has been the only treatment. For spindlecellhemangioma, simple excision is reportedly curative; however, new growths develop in adjacent skin and softtissuesin 60% of affected individuals. For individuals with papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), excision of the involvedlymph nodes, as well as the mass, has been recommended. Surgical excision is reportedly also the usual treatment for individuals with retiform hemangioendothelioma (although local recurrence with this type is common), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and composite hemangioendothelioma (with the exception of 1 case treated withinterferon).Most individuals with pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma have been treated with simple excision, but a few individuals have also received post-surgicalradiotherapy(RT).With regard to kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, some large lesions cannot be completely removed and may cause fatal complications due to the associatedKasabach–Merritt syndrome. In these cases, several medical therapies have been used, includingsystemic corticosteroids;alfa interferon; RT; embolization; and several other therapies, both alone and in various combinations.[1]A study by Scott et al published in 2012 in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology evaluated the effectiveness of RT as either an alternative or adjunct to surgery. The authors stated that the effectiveness of definitive RT in the treatment of hemangioendothelioma in their study implies that radiation may be an acceptable alternative when surgical resection will compromise function or cosmetic result. They concluded that with no local recurrences and minimal risk of toxicity, their long-term data suggest that RT offers a highly effective management option for this disease.[3]"
Hemangiopericytoma,Radical surgical resectionwith removal of all meningeal attachments is typically the preferred treatment. However this treatment option is generally possible in only 50-67% of patients who have meningeal hemangiopericytoma.Embolizationprior to surgery is recommended because of the excessive bleeding associated with thesetumors.[3]Embolization is a method of stopping the blood flow to the tumor. This can be done mechanicially or through the use of chemicals that cause blood vessels to close. If chemicals that killcellsare used during embolization the procedure is referred to as chemoembolization.[2]
Progressive hemifacial atrophy,"Currently there is no treatment to stop the progression of progressive hemifacial atrophy, but various treatments have been tried. Because it is very similar tolinear sclerodermatreatment is also similar, and may include:[5][11][10]AntimalarialsMethotrexateLocal or systemicsteroidsTetracyclineCyclophosphamideNon-cosmetic skin softeners (emollients)Vitamin D3 analoguesTreatment with drugs that become active when exposed to ultraviolet light (phototherapy), for examplePUVA(Psoralen plus ultraviolet A)Hemicranial painsyndrome(can be in form of migraine or continuous severe headache, but on one side of the head)  has been treated successfully by repetitive localbotulinum toxin A injections.[5]Treatment of the eye and nerve involvement  may include the use of some medications, such as steroids, and surgical procedures, depending on the specific problem.[2][5]Progressive hemifacial atrophy stops progressing on its own within 2 to 20 years, which makes it hard to decide if a therapy is successful. After the condition does stabilize, reconstructive surgery can be done to restore the fattissuethat is lost with the disease and, therefore, recover the natural shape of the face, and treat the sunken eye (enophthalmos) and the eyelid retraction.[5]The following techniques are options for surgical reconstruction:[5][11]Silicone implantsMuscle flap graftsFat grafts with or withoutstem cellsBone and cartilage graftsInjections to fill in hollows below the skin such ashyaluronic injection, which may be also improve the enophthalmos and eyelid retraction.Since multiple systems of the body may be affected, a multidisciplinary team of physicians, surgeons, dentists, and psychologists may be needed to manage the different symptoms.[2][5][6][7]"
Hemimegalencephaly,"Because theseizuresassociated with hemimegalencephaly are difficult to control with anti-epileptic medications, most patients undergo surgery to separate one hemisphere of the brain from the other (hemispherectomy). There are several surgical options to consider. One is functional hemispherectomy which involves severing the nerves andtissueconnecting one side of the brain to the other, leaving the brain within the skull. Another is a complete or anatomic hemispherectomy in which the affected side of the brain is surgically removed. These surgeries are usually performed by a neurosurgeon with experience treatingepilepsysyndromes.[1][3]Over time, the remaining side of the brain may take over the functions lost.[3]"
Hemiplegic migraine,"Treatment of hemiplegic migraine varies depending on severity and which symptoms are most problematic for the patient. In general, treatments aim to manage symptoms. Drugs that are effective in the prevention of common migraines may be used in hemiplegic migraine.[3]Prophylacticmanagement is applied to patients with frequent, long lasting, or severe attacks. Examples of migraine drugs that have been tried with variable success in people with hemiplegic migraine, include oral verapamil, acetazolamide, lamotrigine.[3]There are a few articles describing the use of nasal administration of ketamine, intravenous verapamil, and triptans for treatment of aura in people with hemiplegic migraine. Use of triptans in hemiplegic migraine is controversial and may be contraindicated in people with severe attacks.[3]For further information on these and other treatments, we recommend that you speak with your healthcare provider."
Hemochromatosis,"Treatment for hemochromatosis may include reducing iron levels by removing blood (phlebotomy),iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications of the disease. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of iron in the body to normal levels, prevent or delayorgandamage from excess iron, and maintain normal amounts of iron throughout the lifetime.[1]Phlebotomy helps to remove excess iron from the body. Most people begin treatment with weekly therapeutic phlebotomy, although sometimes treatment is initially twice a week if iron levels are very elevated. Maintenance phlebotomy usually involves treatment every 2-4 months.[6]Iron chelation therapy may be recommended for some people with hemochromatosis if they have other health issues. This involves removing excess iron using medications.[7]Dietary recommendations for people with hemochromatosis may include avoiding alcohol and red meat. People with hemochromatosis are not recommended to take iron or vitamin C supplements.[7]For more detailed information regarding the treatment of hemochromatosis, please reference theMedscape article about hemochromatosis.You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free."
Hemochromatosis type 3,"Treatment for hemochromatosis type 3 may include reducing iron levels by removing blood (phlebotomy),iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications of the disease. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of iron in the body to normal levels, prevent or delayorgandamage from excess iron, and maintain normal amounts of iron throughout the lifetime.[1]Phlebotomy helps to remove excess iron from the body. Most people begin treatment with weekly therapeutic phlebotomy, although sometimes treatment is initially twice a week if iron levels are very elevated. Maintenance phlebotomy usually involves treatment every 2-4 months.[7]Iron chelation therapy may be recommended for some people with hemochromatosis type 3 if they have other health issues. This involves removing excess iron using medications.[7]Dietary recommendations for people with hemochromatosis may include avoiding alcohol and red meat. People with hemochromatosis are not recommended to take iron or vitamin C supplements.[7]For more detailed information regarding the treatment of hemochromatosis, please reference theMedscape article about hemochromatosis.You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free."
Hemochromatosis type 2,"Treatment for hemochromatosis type 2 may include reducing iron levels by removing blood (phlebotomy),iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications of the disease. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of iron in the body to normal levels, prevent or delayorgandamage from excess iron, and maintain normal amounts of iron throughout the lifetime.[3]Phlebotomy helps to remove excess iron from the body. Most people begin treatment with weekly therapeutic phlebotomy, although sometimes treatment is initially twice a week if iron levels are very elevated. Maintenance phlebotomy usually involves treatment every 2-4 months.[8]Iron chelation therapy may be recommended for some people with hemochromatosis type 2 if they have other health issues. This involves removing excess iron using medications.[8]The use of these therapies to treat hemochromatosis type 2 can greatly reduce the risk of organ damage.[9]Dietary recommendations for people with hemochromatosis may include avoiding alcohol and red meat. People with hemochromatosis are not recommended to take iron or vitamin C supplements.[8]Hormonereplacement therapy may be used to replace low sex hormones.[1]For more detailed information regarding the treatment of hemochromatosis, please reference theMedscape article about hemochromatosis.You may need to register to view the article, but registration is free."
Hemoglobin E disease,Treatment for hemoglobin E disease is typically not needed.Folic acidsupplements may be prescribed to help the body produce normalred blood cellsif mildanemiacauses symptoms. Most people do not have any symptoms. People with hemoglobin E disease can expect to lead a normal life.[1][5]
Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA,"Unfortunately, there is currently no cure or standard treatment for people with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA). Affected people and their families should consult with a medical genetics team for information about the diagnosis, counseling, up-to-date treatment options, and referrals to support groups and organizations. Treatment requires ongoing care with trained pediatric specialists in various medical fields. A consultation with a developmentalpediatricianis especially helpful in addressing behavioral concerns and to assist parents and caregivers in establishing a sleep routine.Currently, drug therapy is not part of the standard of care for MPS IIIA. Medications are used to relieve symptoms (such as anticonvulsants forseizures) and improve quality of life. Sedatives andmelatoninhave been used to improve the quality of sleep along with establishing a bedtime routine. Specific therapies such asbone marrow transplantationandenzymereplacement therapy (ERT) are currently not options for patients with MPS IIIA.Hematopoietic stem cell transplantationhas shown mixed results and an unclear neurocognitive benefit.Recombinantenzymes for the deficiencies in MPS III are available, but trials in ERT have not been favorable in improvingprognosisbecause the enzymes are not able to enter thecentral nervous system.[6]Changes to the diet do not prevent disease progression, but limiting milk, sugar, and dairy products has helped some people who have excessive mucus.[7]"
Wilson disease,"There is currently no cure for Wilson disease; however, therapies exist that aim to reduce or control the amount of copper that accumulates in the body. Affected people require lifelong treatment, which may include certain medications and/or dietary modifications. If treatment is not effective or if liver failure develops, aliver transplantmay be necessary.[5][1][2]For more specific information on the treatment and management of Wilson disease, please visit theNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease's (NIDDK) websiteand/orGeneReviews.

"Hereditary endotheliopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and stroke","At this time, there is no effective treatment for hereditary endotheliopathy with retinopathy, nephropathy, and stroke (HERNS). Treatment of HERNS is largely palliative, which means that it is aimed at decreasing pain by providing treatments that may help relieve some of the symptoms, along with providing comfort and support. In some cases, aspirin may be recommended. Laser treatment of the eyes may be beneficial to some people.[1]Other treatment options may be recommended depending on the signs and symptoms of each person.[3]"
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia,"Although current treatment cannot stoptelangiectasiasorarteriovenous malformations(AVMs) from forming, many of the symptoms and complications associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) can be treated or prevented.[4]Management of HHT includes checking for new or worsening AVMs and the treatment of complications such as nosebleeds, bleeding from the intestines or stomach, andanemia. Treatment of AVMs of the lung (pulmonary), brain (cerebral) and liver (hepatic) may also be recommended.[2][4]Reducing the number and severity of nosebleeds can help prevent anemia. Treatment of nosebleeds may include using a vaporizer to increase the moisture of room air and keeping the inside of nose moist using nasal lubricants or sprays. Laser therapy may be used to remove the abnormal blood vessels (laser ablation). Other treatment may include medication orhormone therapy, but the effectiveness and safety of these treatments has not been established. If the nosebleeds continue despite other treatment, skin  from a different part of the body may be grafted to replace the thin lining of the nose (septal dermoplasty) in an effort to cover and protect the fragile telangiectases.[2][4]Bleeding in the intestine or stomach is usually only treated if oral iron supplements cannot keep iron levels high enough to avoid anemia. Treatment may include surgical removal of AVMs or laser therapy to destroy and close the AVMs. If severe bleeding with uncontrolled anemia develops, treatment of AVMs in the stomach or intestine may include medication or hormone therapy, but the effectiveness and safety of these treatments has not been established. In addition to oral iron supplements, anemia may be treated by intravenous (IV) iron therapy or, in more severe cases,red blood celltransfusions.[2][4]Treatment of AVMs of the lungs (pulmonary AVMs) is recommended if the person with HHT is having a hard time breathing (dyspnea), is unable to exercise without extreme fatigue (exercise intolerance), or has low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia). Treatment of pulmonary AVMs  may also be performed to prevent lunghemorrhageand the neurologic complications ofbrain abscessesand/orstroke. Treatment may include inserting a small inflated balloon or small metal coil in the artery that leads into the AVM in order to stop the blood flow through the AVM (embolotherapy) or surgical removal of the AVM.[2][4]People with pulmonary AVMs are advised to take extra precautions to avoid serious complications. These recommendations include takingantibioticsbefore dental or surgical procedures, using special filters in IV lines to prevent even tiny air bubbles from entering the blood stream, avoidingblood thinnersandnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(such as aspirin, ibuprofin, and naproxen), and regular monitoring by a doctor familiar with HHT.[4]AVMs in the brain (cerebral AVMs) greater than 1.0 cm in diameter may be surgically removed. Alternative treatment includes inserting a small inflated balloon or glue-like substance to stop the blood flow through the artery involved in the AVM (embolotherapy) and/or using a narrow, focused beam of radiation to destroy the AVM (stereotactic radiosurgery).[2][4]AVMs in the liver (hepatic AVMs) are currently treated only if a person shows signs ofheart failureor significant health problems related to the liver not working properly. Treatment might include standard heart failure medications, liver transplantation, or medications likebevacizumab.[4]In addition, guidelines for people with HHT recommend annual evaluations for anemia and neurologic conditions and re-evaluation for pulmonary AVMs every one to two years during childhood and every five years thereafter. Blood tests to check for anemia may be recommended more often depending on the frequency and severity of nose bleeds or if an intestinal or stomach AVM is bleeding. Women with HHT considering pregnancy are screened and treated for pulmonary AVMs; if pulmonary AVMs are discovered during pregnancy, they are treated during the second trimester.[2]"
Hereditary multiple osteochondromas,"Currently, there is no known medical treatment for HMO. Osteochondromas are not usually removed because they stop growing around age 12. Another consideration is how close thetumoris to the affected bone's growth plate, because surgery can affect how the bone grows.[1][5]Surgery may be considered, however, if an osteochondroma is causing pain, bone fracture, nerve irritation, or if the tumor continues to grow after the person's bones have stopped growing.[1][5]The surgical treatment of choice is complete removal of the tumor. Depending on the location of the osteochondroma, this may be relatively simple. However, if an osteochondroma is close to nerves and blood vessels, this may make surgery difficult and risky.[5]Surgery may also be necessary to correct painful limb abnormalities that are caused by multiple osteochondromas. Surgery may be needed to cut and realign the bones that have become deformed, which is known as osteotomy.[5]If the legs are not equal in length, treatment may include a procedure to slow down the growth of the longer leg. Surgery may also be needed to correct the forearm deformity seen in this condition. Adults with this condition who have untreated forearm deformities usually do not have significant functional limitations.[1]Although rare, an osteochondroma can become cancerous (malignant), which usually takes the form of a low grade chondrosarcoma. This type of malignant tumor is unlikely to spread elsewhere in the body. Higher grades ofcancercan occur, but this is even more uncommon. In that case, other therapies, such aschemotherapyand radiation, may be used in treatment.[1][5]GeneReviewsprovides more information about treatment for hereditary multiple osteochondromas."
Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy,"There is no specific treatment for hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy. Treatment is based on an individual's symptoms. Some people with this condition use braces, such as awrist splintor ankle-foot orthosis (AFO). Protective pads worn at the elbows or knees may prevent pressure and trauma to local nerves. Activities to avoid include prolonged sitting with legs crossed, occupations requiring repetitive movements of the wrist, prolonged leaning on elbows, and rapid weight loss.Vincristine, commonly used in the treatment oflymphoma, has been reported to worsen the symptoms of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy. Surgical decompression of nerves remains a controversial treament for this condition.[2]"
Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1,"Management of hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 generally follows the guidelines fordiabetic foot care, including careful cleansing and protection of wounds and surgical care when needed. Pain medications may be used by those who experience shooting pains.[4]"
Leukonychia totalis,"There is no universally successful treatment for the whitening of the nails in people with leukonychia totalis.[3]However, if the condition is known to have an underlying cause, treating that cause (when possible) may improve the condition."
Hypereosinophilic syndrome,"The treatment and management of hypereosinophilicsyndrome(HES) varies based on the severity of the condition and if an underlying cause for theeosinophiliahas been identified. For example, in people with myeloproliferative HES who have a somaticgene deletionleading to theFIP1L1/PDGFRAfusion gene,imatinibis the drug of choice.[1][2][3]Affected people without theFIP1L1/PDGFRAfusiongeneare typically treated withcorticosteroidsinitially. Approximately one third of these cases do not respond to steroids so other agents, such ashydroxyurea,interferon-alpha, and imatinib, may be administered.[1][2][3]In people who are affected by HES that do not respond to standard treatments, other therapies may be tried, includingchemotherapyand hematopoieticstem celltransplantation; however, there is little data regarding the effectiveness of these treatments so they are not routinely given.[1][2][3]"
Heterotaxy,"The treatment for heterotaxy depends on the specificorgansthat are affected in each individual. In infants diagnosed with the condition, heart surgery may be necessary to correct anyheart defects. For some individuals, this may require multiple procedures to correct the defect. One common procedure is known as aFontan procedure, which creates a single ventricle of the heart that is responsible for pumping blood both throughout the body and to the lungs. Other surgical procedures such as theLadd proceduremay be necessary to correct an intestinal malrotation.[6]Other treatment options include inserting apacemakerto control the rhythm of the heart. Some individuals may require medications to lower blood pressure to reduce stress on the heart.Vaccinationsorantibioticsthat are taken even when there isn’t an infection (prophylactic antibiotics) may be recommended to make up for a spleen that isn’t functioning properly. In some cases, aheart transplantmay be necessary when individuals who had surgical corrections as infants get older. A multidisciplinary team of doctors may be recommended to follow a person who is diagnosed with heterotaxy.[4]"
Nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency,"When severeanemiais present, blood transfusions may be necessary. Affected individuals should avoid any drugs that can cause destruction ofred blood cells, as well as any environmental triggers that may be identified.[6]"
Progeria,"Management for progeria generally focuses on the signs and symptoms of the condition and may include the following:Exercise, diet modification, and medication when the lipid profile becomes abnormalFrequent small meals to maximize caloric intakeOral hydrationUse of shoe pads for foot discomfort due to lack of body fatUse of sunscreen on all exposed areas of skinNitroglycerin for anginaRoutine anticongestive therapy ifcongestive heart failureis presentStatinsfor their putative effect on farnesylation inhibitionAnticoagulation therapyif vascular blockage,transient ischemic attacks, stroke, angina, or heart attack occurRoutine physical and occupational therapy to help maintain range of motion in large and small joints[4]Although there is currently no cure for progeria, research involving treatments is ongoing and scientists have been making much progress. The results of a recently publishedphase II clinical trialprovided preliminary evidence that lonafarnib, afarnesyltransferase inhibitor, may improve cardiovascular status, bone structure, and audiological (hearing) status in affected children.[5]A free, full-text version of this study is available on PubMed and can be viewed byclicking here."
Hypotrichosis simplex,"Individuals with hypotrichosis simplex experience a gradual loss of scalp hair that begins during the middle of the first decade and results in almost complete loss of hair by the third decade. A few sparse, fine, short hairs may remain in some individuals.[3]There is currently no treatment for hypotrichosis simplex.[2]"
Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma,"Treatment is determined for each affected individual based on the size of thetumorand whether it has spread to other parts of the body.[1]Currently, it is believed that the best treatment for sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma consists of multiple therapies, including surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, andchemotherapyand/orradiation therapyto destroy anycancercellsthat may remain in the body.[1][6]If surgery can remove the tumor completely, and it is followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the survival outcome is better. In cases where the tumor can't be completely removed by surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are indicated.[7]Other treatment options are currently being studied, such asboron neutron capture therapy,autologous bone marrow transplant, andneoadjuvant selective intra-arterial cisplatin with concurrent radiation therapy, which showed limited success. Other researches are investigating the use ofTK-inhibitors targeting c-KIT(e.g.Imatinib/Gleevac).[8]Follow-up treatment can involve dental prostheses, eye prostheses, and visits with dentists andophthalmologists, in addition to regular follow-up with the original treating doctors for cancer follow-up. This follow-up consists of regularmagnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and, if necessary,tissuebiopsy.[9]"
Immunodeficiency with hyper IgM type 1,"The cornerstone of treatment for individuals with hyper IgMsyndromeis regular injections of intravenous immunogloblulin (IVIG). This treatment not only supplies missing IgGantibodies, but also prompts a drop in IgM antibodies.[5][3]Patients with neutropenia can takegranulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF).Antibioticsmay also be prescribed to prevent the respiratory infection, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.[3]Most children with hyper-IgM syndrome respond well to treatment, become symptom-free and resume normal growth.[5]"
Insulin autoimmune syndrome,"The treatment of insulin autoimmunesyndromeis similar to treatments for other conditions that causelow blood sugar. This includes eating smaller meals more frequently in order to maintain a more consistent blood sugar level and continuous monitoring of blood sugar. Additional treatment options can include treatment with steroids and a procedure calledplasmaphoresiswhich removes the blood from the body, separates the insulinantibodiesin the blood stream, and replaces the blood without the antibodies. Any damage to the pancreas may also require treatment.[7][8]"
