Windblown hand,"Treatment of windblown hand may involve surgical correction and reconstruction. Because windblown hand has many variations, each patient must be treated individually.[1]We recommend speaking with a healthcare provider to discuss your treatment options. In addition, it may be helpful to set up a consultation with a hand surgeon. The following tool can help you locate a hand surgeon in your area.American Society for Surgery of HandFind-A-Hand Surgeon:http://www.assh.org/Public/Pages/HandSurgeons.aspxIn addition, because windblown hand is thought to possibly be a variant form of arthrogryposis you may find the following Web page with links to help you locate arthrogryposis specialists and specialty centers to be helpful.A National Support group for Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (AVENUES)http://www.avenuesforamc.com/medpros/med.htm"
Congenital vertical talus,"Congenitalvertical talus should be treated early to avoid pain and disability when the child learns to walk. The most common treatment is surgery, but some doctors may first recommend trying nonsurgical treatment. This may include a series of stretching andserial castingto increase the flexibility of the foot.[1]This may decrease the amount of surgery that is needed, or, in some cases, prevent the need for surgery.[2]In most cases, surgery is recommended at around 9 to 12 months of age. The goal of surgery is to correct all aspects of the deformity, which includes the position of the bones as well as the ligaments and tendons that support these bones. When the bones are put in the correct position, pins may be  inserted for a few weeks to keep them in place. Any tendons or ligaments that may have shortened as a result of the deformity may be lengthened. In most cases, recovery with a cast takes about 4 to 6 weeks. A brace or special shoe may be needed for a period of time to prevent the deformity from returning.[1]If congenital vertical talus occurs in association with otherbirth defectsor an underlying geneticsyndromeorneuromuscular disorder, treatment recommendations may differ depending on the associated abnormality."
Small patella syndrome,"The treatment for small patellasyndrome(SPS) may depend on the severity of symptoms in each person with the syndrome. Some people with SPS may benefit from pain-relieving medications,occupational therapy, orphysical therapy. Other people may require surgery to repair the kneecap.[1][2]Other features of SPS may be treated as they would in people who do not have SPS. For example,scoliosismay be treated with bracing or surgery.Pulmonary arterial hypertensionmay be treated with medications or supplemental oxygen.[7]"
Schwannomatosis,"Treatment for schwannomatosis is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, pain is one of the most common symptoms of the condition. Treatment with medications such asgabapentinorpregabalinand the use of short-acting opioids and/ornonsteroidal anti-inflammatoriesfor pain can be successful for many patients. If pain cannot be managed with other means or if the schwannomas are causing other symptoms, they can be surgically removed. However this treatment is often used as a last resort because surgery may put patients at risk of further neurologic problems.[2]"
Sprengel deformity,"Treatment of Sprengel deformity depends on the degree of functional impairment and/or cosmetic disfigurement. Many people with Sprengel deformity do not need surgery and may havephysical therapyto maintain range of motion and strengthen weak muscles.[1]For those who do require surgery, the goals are to release the binding of the scapula and relocate the scapula.[1]Surgery can improve the cosmetic appearance and contour of the neck, and improve the scapular function when it is severely impaired. However, the ability to increase shoulder abduction is limited.[1]For surgical indication, many experts refer to the Cavendish classification - one method used for grading the severity of Sprengel deformity.[5]This method classifies the condition into grades I through IV, with grade I being the most mild (almost invisible when covered with clothes) and grade IV being the most severe (with over 5 centimeters of elevation of the shoulder, and neck webbing).[2]Although no improvement or worsening has been reported in untreated grade I and II cases, surgery is recommended in grade III and IV deformities. However, the Cavendish classification may be subjective and inaccurate since it is based on the structure of the deformity (rather than function) and aesthetic criteria.[5]The optimal age for surgery is controversial, but most experts recommend that it be done before age 8 to obtain the best surgical result. There are several surgical options that may be considered depending on each person's situation. Many of the surgical procedures for Sprengel deformity leave unsightly scars, so the cosmetic improvement must be carefully considered.[1]"
Linear porokeratosis,"There are no established treatment recommendations for any form of porokeratosis because no randomizedclinical trialshave been done. Treatment options depend on each person's symptoms and concerns. Responses to treatment are unpredictable, so a person may have to try more than one treatment, or a combination of treatments.[2]Options for treatment of porokeratosis may include:[2][1]Topical therapies such as5-fluorouracil(5-FU),imiquimod,retinoids, andcalcipotriol.Oral retinoids.Cryotherapy.Electrodessication.Surgical removal.Linear porokeratosis can progress to skincancer(squamous cellandbasal cell carcinoma). If the purpose of treatment is to prevent its progression to cancer, surgical removal is typically recommended. Sun protection is also important to decrease the risk for cancer. Watching for changes within patches may help to detect cancer earlier.[1][2]"
Factor XIII deficiency,"The amount of Factor XIII necessary for a normal response to trauma is only about 10 percent of that in the normal plasma. People with Factor XIII deficiency are generally given small infusions of fresh or frozen blood plasma (cryoprecipitates), or Factor XIII concentrates every three or four weeks. This has proven to be a highly successful preventive treatment for the disorder. Patients typically have a normal response to trauma while on these transfusions. When patients with Factor XIII deficiency have a high incidence of bleeding inside the head (intracranial), preventive treatment is necessary.[1]In February 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration approvedCorifact, a product manufactured by CSL Behring of Marburg, Germany, to prevent bleeding in people withcongenitalFactor XIII deficiency. Corifact is made from the pooled plasma of healthy donors. It can be used for individuals with absent or decreased levels of FXIII.[3]People receiving Corifact may developantibodiesagainst Factor XIII that may make the product ineffective. It potentially can cause adverse events from abnormal clotting if doses higher than the labeled dose are given to patients. Cryoprecipitate should not be used to treat patients with factor XIII deficiency except in life- and limb-threatening emergencies when Factor XIII concentrate is not immediately available.[3]"
Microvillus inclusion disease,"While different medications have been tried to control the severe diarrhea associated with this condition, none of them have proven effective.[1]Children with microvillus inclusion disease are totally dependent onparenteral nutritionfor nourishment. This, however, is not a long-term solution, as children who rely on this type of nutrition are at increased risk for malnutrition, dehydration, infections and liver complications. A more recent and long-term management option involvesintestinal (small bowel) transplantation.[1][2]Children with microvillus inclusion disease should be followed by experienced health care providers in a center which specializes in pediatric gastrointestinal disorders.[2]"
Milroy disease,"There is currently no cure for Milroy disease. Management is typically conservative and usually successful in most people.[3]Management of lymphedema should be guided by a lymphedema therapist. Some improvement is usually possible with the use of properly fitted compression hosiery or bandaging and well fitting, supportive shoes. Good skin care is essential. These measures may improve the cosmetic appearance of the affected areas, decrease their size, and reduce the risk of complications.[2]Decongestivephysiotherapy, which combines compression bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage (a specialized massage technique), exercise, breathing exercises, dietary measures and skin care, has become the standard of care for primary lymphedema.[3]People with recurrent cellulitis may benefit fromprophylacticantibiotics.[2][3]Surgical intervention is considered a last option when other medical management fails.[3]When possible, people with Milroy disease should avoid:[2]wounds to swollen areas (because of their reduced resistance to infection)long periods of immobilityprolonged standingelevation of the affected limbcertain medications (particularly calcium channel-blocking drugs that can cause increased leg swelling in some people)"
Lamellar ichthyosis,"Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for lamellar ichthyosis. Management is generally supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For infants, providing a moist environment in an isolette (incubator) and preventing infection are most important. Petrolatum-based creams and ointments are used to keep the skin soft, supple, and hydrated. As affected children become older, treatments to promote peeling and thinning of the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of skincells) are often recommended. This may include humidification with long baths, lubrication, and keratolytic agents such as alpha-hydroxy acid or urea preparations.[1]For people withectropion(turning out of the eyelid), lubrication of the cornea with artificial tears or prescription ointments is helpful to prevent the cornea from drying out. Topical or oral retinoid therapy may be recommended for those with severe skin involvement; however, these medications can be associated with undesired side effects and are, therefore, generally prescribed with caution.[1]"
Congenital laryngeal palsy,"The most common treatments for vocal fold paralysis are voice therapy and surgery. Some people's voices will naturally recover sometime during the first year after diagnosis, which is why doctors often delay surgery for at least a year. During this time, aspeech-language pathologistmay be needed for voice therapy, which may involve exercises to strengthen the vocal folds or improve breath control while speaking. Patients may also learn how to use the voice differently, for example, by speaking more slowly or opening the mouth wider when speaking.
Treatment may include:[2][3]Corticosteroids: When there is an associated disease such asWegener's granulomatosis,sarcoidosisor polychondritis.Medical treatment of the disease that lead to an inflammation of the cricoarytenoid joint ( gout) or the laryngeal mucosa such assyphilisandtuberculosis(resulting in mechanical attachment of the vocal cords) to improve breathing.Diabetes treatment: Can help to improve a neuropathy of the vocal cords caused by thediabetes mellitus.Treatment of reflux: When the condition is caused by the gastroesophageal reflux.Treatment of the eventual scarring of the arytenoid cartilages.Several surgical procedures depending on whether one or both of the vocal cords are paralyzed. The most common procedures change the position of the vocal fold. These may involve inserting a structural implant or stitches to reposition the laryngeal cartilage and bring the vocal folds closer together. These procedures usually result in a stronger voice. Surgery is followed by additional voice therapy to help fine-tune the voice:• Functional procedures as microflap, laryngectomy (similar to tracheostomy) with subsequent cricoidotomia (removal of the cricoid cartilage) and cartilage graft and stent (or stent placement only) or reconstruction of the local mucosa with scar removal.•	Tracheotomy: May be required to help breathing. In a tracheotomy, an incision is made in the front of the neck and a breathing tube is inserted through an opening, called a stoma, into the trachea. Rather than occurring through the nose and mouth, breathing now happens through the tube. Following surgery, therapy with a speech-languagepathologisthelps you learn how to use the voice and how to properly care for the breathing tube•	Permanent treatments with removal of the vocal cords (unilateral or bilateral) or the arytenoid cartilage (endoscopic or external, partial or complete) or changing the position of the vocal cords.Other treatment may include:[2]•	Reinnervation techniques (experimental)•	Electrical stimulation (experimental).Most cases of unilateral vocal cord paralysis do not need any treatment.  Adopting a vertical position is sometimes enough to relieve breathing problems but in some patients it may require an intubation."
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome,"There is no cure for Shwachman-Diamondsyndrome(SDS).  The treatment is directed to the symptoms or signals that the patient has. It is important to have several specialists taking care of the patients, likehematologists,gastroenterologists,geneticists, orthopedics,endocrinologists,immunologistsor others, as needed. The treatment may include:[3][5]•Oral pancreatic enzyme replacementwith meals in those who are pancreatic insufficient.• Supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and a low fat diet.• Blood and/orplatelettransfusions may be done if the patient is anemic or have low whitecellcounts in the blood.
•Antibioticsandgranulocyte-colony stimulation factor (G-CSF)if there are infections and the white cell blood count are low (500/mm3 or less).•Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT), which are cells that are isolated from the blood or bone marrow and can renew themselves, in cases of severe pancytopenia (low of all blood cells),myelodysplastic syndrome, oracute myelogenous leukemia(AML).•	Use of medicines to treatcancer(chemotherapy) before doing the HSCT when the patient have acute myelogenous leukemia.•Growth hormonehas been used to treat children with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome who have growthhormonedeficiency.Bone marrow abnormalities are not treated unless there is severe aplasia or myelodysplastic changes, or AML.
Some children who have bone abnormalities may need surgery if they have respiratory problems (rib problems resulting in asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy), asymmetric growth or joint problems.
It is recommended to have consultation with an endocrinologist if the child is having poor growth and delayed puberty, as well as frequent visits to the dentist to reduce the chances of having mouth wounds (ulcers) and gingivitis.[3]"
Macroglossia,"Medical therapy for macroglossia is useful when the underlying cause is identified, and the cause is medically treatable - such as hypothyroidism, infection, or amyloidosis. No medical treatments have been proven useful when the cause is unclear. Surgery to reduce the size of the tongue may be an option for people with macroglossia. Most studies have shown that surgical procedures for macroglossia lead to improved physical appearance, speech, chewing and feeding.[3]More detailed information about the treatment options for macroglossia is available on Medscape Reference's Web site."
Congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A,"There is currently no cure forcongenitalmuscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) and treatment generally focuses on managing the individual signs and symptoms of the condition. A multidisciplinary approach is often needed and may improve the quality and longevity of life. This may include a joint effort by orthopedic and respiratory specialists; physiotherapists;occupational therapists; and speech-language therapists. The main objective is helping each affected individual reach their full potential.Seizuresor other neurological complications may require specific treatment. Theprognosisof this condition is poor, as many affected children do not reach adolescence.[1]"
Pachyonychia congenita,"There is no cure for pachyonychia congenita (PC). Current management is focused on relief of pain and other symptoms; hygienic grooming practices (such as trimming the nails and calluses); and treatment of infections when necessary. Some affected people may also require aids to help with mobility, such as wheelchairs, crutches and/or canes.[2][5]Pachyonychia Congenita Projectoffers more detailed information regarding the treatment and management of PC. Please click on the link to access this resource."
Congenital radioulnar synostosis,"Congenitalradioulnar synostosis may be treated with surgery. Surgery is more commonly performed in patients who have bilateral radioulnar synostosis and/or patients who have very limited movement due to the radioulnar synostosis. In some cases, surgery is best performed in early childhood, usually before school starts, and in some cases it may need to be done in several stages. Surgery is not generally recommended for older patients with milder deformities who have learned to compensate for the limited range of movement caused by the synostosis, by using their shoulders and/or wrists. Complications of the surgery may include nerve damage or recurrence of the fusion.[2]For in-depth information about the treatment of congenital radioulnar synostosis, please visitMedscape. You may have to register to view the article, but registration is free."
Hereditary spherocytosis,"The treatment of hereditary spherosytosis (HS) is dependent on the severity of the condition and recommendations vary a bit in the medical literature. In general,folate therapy(a type of vitamin B to supportred blood cellproduction) is recommended for those with moderate to severeanemia, although some doctors may also recommend it for those with mild anemia.Red blood cell transfusionsmay be required in severe cases of anemia, particularly in the first years of life or during infections and pregnancy. If red bloodcelltransfusions are needed repeatedly,iron chelating therapymay be required to reduceiron overload.[2][3][4]Regular monitoring for anemia andgallstonesis advised. Removal of the spleen (splenectomy) is usually only performed in severe HS or in moderate to severe cases with significant anemia and gallstone complications. Splenectomy is not recommended in cases of mild HS except in specific cases. The majority of medical researchers no longer recommend that the spleen be removed during gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy), unless there are other reasons to do so. In some cases only removing of part of the spleen is advised. Expert evaluation is recommended in order to avoid unnecessary spleen removal.[2][3][4]"
Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency,"CSID is typically treated by modifying a person's diet to reduce the amount of sucrose. Because many foods contain sucrose and other complex sugars, it can be difficult to completely remove sucrase from the diet. Sacrosidase is an oral medication containing theenzymethat does not work properly in people with this condition. By taking this medication, those with CSID can eat sucrose-containing foods because this enzyme will break down sucrose. This medication must be taken with each meal or snack.[2]"
Marden-Walker syndrome,"Very little information is available regarding the treatment of Marden-Walkersyndrome. In general, treatment is symptomatic, with a multidisciplinary approach.[3]The team of providers may include a regularpediatrician, ageneticist, aneurologist, anorthopedistand/or a physical medicine specialist. Special diets and feeding techniques may be of benefit. Early childhood intervention services may help with developmental problems. Other treatments are dependent upon the specific symptoms present in each patient.[7]"
Conversion disorder,"For some people, the symptoms of conversion disorder may improve with time, even without treatment. This can occur after they receive a diagnosis of the disorder, reassurance that the symptoms aren’t caused by an underlying problem, and validation that the symptoms are real.[2]Individuals with severe symptoms, symptoms that linger or keep coming back, or other mental or physical health problems may require treatment. The specific type of treatment depends on the particular signs and symptoms of the disorder and may include:[2][7]Counseling (psychotherapy)HypnosisPhysical therapyOccupational therapyTreatment of related physical or psychological stressors"
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,"The treatment of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) generally depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people who are mildly affected may simply be monitored as some cases can improve on their own. Unfortunately, the majority of people with COP have persistent and/or progressive symptoms that will require therapy. In these cases, oral or intravenousglucocorticoidscan be given which often result in rapid improvement of symptoms.[2][3]"
Menkes disease,"Treatment is based on the symptoms. It may include inserting a tube through a small opening in the abdomen that delivers nutrition directly to the stomach (gastrostomy tube or G-tube) to ensure an adequate nutrition.  Some people who have pouches in the bladder (bladder diverticulum) may need surgery.[3]Early administration of copper may extend the patient’s life and can prevent neurologic damage in some patients (about 30% of cases) or improve the symptoms when it is started very early. The copper is administrated (as copper histidine or copper chloride) into a vein (intravenous (IV)), or by injecting it under the skin (subcutaneous) because when it is given by mouth it is not absorbed by the intestines. Some studies have shown that if copper administration starts before 10 days of life in certain cases there are no neurological problems. Also, the treatment may also result in fewerseizuresand less irritability. Other treatment may include:[2][3]Penicillamine:  To avoid excess of copper during the treatmentVitamin C: It may increase the effectiveness of the copper treatment but there is no real evidence of being effectiveVitamin E: It has been suggested as a treatment perhaps by its antioxidant propertyInsertionofgenetic material(DNA) of the normalgenedirectly into the brain, usingviruscarrying the DNA (viral gene therapy). This type of treatment is still in researchL-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS): Results in the improvementdopamine deficiency beta-hydroxylase (DBH)that is one of theenzymesimpaired in the disease.Developmental interventionSeveral investigationsare ongoing to find more effective treatments."
Cor triatriatum sinister,"Treatment for cor triatriatum sinister varies depending on the symptoms. For patients with milder cases who are diagnosed much later in life, surgery may not be needed.[2]In symptomatic patients, treatment may include diuretics, medications to change the force of the heart's contractions (inotropic medications), and medications to prevent clots from forming (anticoagulant therapy).[2][1]Surgery, however, is considered the definitive therapy for those who are symptomatic.[2][3]The overall life expectancy after surgical repair is expected to be similar to that for the general population.[4]"
Meesmann corneal dystrophy,"Treatment is usually not needed unless a person is experiencing symptoms. Most people only need lubricating eye drops. If symptoms are more severe, therapeutic contact lenses or cycloplegic eye drops may be used for severe sensitivity to light (photophobia). Hypertonic saline may be given if symptoms get worse when a person wakes up. Surgical procedures are sometimes tried when these treatments do not help, and may include epithelialdebridement, orkeratectomy. There is a high risk of recurrence with these procedures. Researchers are also evaluating a form ofgene therapycalledRNAinterference (RNAi) which is also called therapeutic siRNA. This therapy may be able to silence themutatedgenethat causes Meesman corneal dystrophy.[4][5][3]"
Cramp-fasciculation syndrome,"There is limited information in the medical literature about the treatment of cramp-fasciculationsyndrome(CFS). Much of what is available describes individual cases. Some people with CFS improve without treatment. Treatment withcarbamazepine,gabapentin,lamotrigine, orpregabalin(medications that reduce the hyper-excitability of nerves) was described as helpful in improving symptoms in individual cases. Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g.,prednisone) has been used to treat cases of CFS that did not respond to other treatments.[3]Decisions regarding treatment should be carefully considered and discussed with a knowledgeable healthcare provider."
Temtamy syndrome,"Unfortunately, there is no cure for Temtamysyndrome. Treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms of the syndrome. These treatment options may include surgeries to treat heart and eye problems and medications to treatseizures.Speech,occupational, andphysical therapiesmay be important to allow children with Temtamy syndrome to reach their full potentials.Developmental delaysmay be helped byearly intervention programs. Additional help in school may also be required, as most children with Temtamy syndrome haveintellectual disability.[1][3]"
Glass-Chapman-Hockley syndrome,"Surgery is typically the treatment forcraniosynostosisand is based on the person's specific signs and symptoms. The goal is to increase the space in the front (anterior) part of the skull. The operation is usually performed when the person is between 9 to 12 months of age. If other sutures, other than the coronal suture, are involved, other surgeries may be performed."
